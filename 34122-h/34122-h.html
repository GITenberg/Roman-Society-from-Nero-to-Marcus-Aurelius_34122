<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There must always be something arbitrary in the choice
and isolation of a period of social history for special study.
No period can, from one point of view, be broken off and isolated
from the immemorial influences which have moulded it, from
the succession of coming ages which it will help to fashion.
And this is specially true of the history of a race at once so
aggressive, yet so tenacious of the past, as the Roman. The
national fibre was so tough, and its tone and sentiment so
conservative under all external changes, that when a man
knows any considerable period of Roman social history, he may
almost, without paradox, be said to know a great deal of it
from Romulus to Honorius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, as in the artistic drama there must be a beginning
and an end, although the action can only be ideally severed
from what has preceded and what is to follow in actual life, so
a limited space in the collective history of a people may be
legitimately set apart for concentrated study. But as in the
case of the drama, such a period should possess a certain
unity and intensity of moral interest. It should be a crisis
and turning-point in the life of humanity, a period pregnant
with momentous issues, a period in which the old order and the
new are contending for mastery, or in which the old is melting
into the new. Above all, it should be one in which the
great social and spiritual movements are incarnate in some
striking personalities, who may give a human interest to dim
forces of spiritual evolution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such a period, it seems to the writer of this book, is that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which he now presents to the reader. It opens with the
self-destruction of lawless and intoxicated power; it closes
with the realisation of Plato’s dream of a reign of the
philosophers. The revolution in the ideal of the principate,
which gave the world a Trajan, a Hadrian, and a Marcus
Aurelius in place of a Caligula and a Nero, may not have
been accompanied by any change of corresponding depth in
the moral condition of the masses. But the world enjoyed
for nearly a century an almost unexampled peace and
prosperity, under skilful and humane government. The civic
splendour and social charities of the Antonine age can be
revived by the imagination from the abundant remains and
records of the period. Its materialism and social vices
will also sadden the thoughtful student of its literature and
inscriptions. But if that age had the faults of a luxurious
and highly organised civilisation, it was also dignified and
elevated by a great effort for reform of conduct, and a
passion, often, it is true, sadly misguided, to rise to a higher
spiritual life and to win the succour of unseen Powers. To
the writer of this book, this seems to give the Antonine age
its great distinction and its deepest interest for the student of
the life of humanity. The influence of philosophy on the
legislation of the Antonines is a commonplace of history.
But its practical effort to give support and guidance to moral
life, and to refashion the old paganism, so as to make it a real
spiritual force, has perhaps hardly yet attracted the notice
which it deserves. It is one great object of this book to
show how the later Stoicism and the new Platonism, working
in eclectic harmony, strove to supply a rule of conduct and a
higher vision of the Divine world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But philosophy failed, as it will probably fail till some
far-off age, to find an anodyne for the spiritual distresses of the
mass of men. It might hold up the loftiest ideal of conduct;
it might revive the ancient gods in new spiritual power; it
might strive to fill the interval between the remote Infinite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Spirit and the life of man with a host of mediating and
succouring powers. But the effort was doomed to failure. It
was an esoteric creed, and the masses remained untouched
by it. They longed for a Divine light, a clear, authoritative
voice from the unseen world. They sought it in ever more
blind and passionate devotion to their ancient deities, and in
all the curiosity of superstition. But the voice came to
them at last from the regions of the East. It came through
the worships of Isis and Mithra, which promised a hope of
immortality, and provided a sacramental system to soothe
the sense of guilt and prepare the trembling soul for the
great ordeal on the verge of another world. How far these
eastern systems succeeded, and where they failed, it is one
great purpose of this book to explain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The writer, so far as he knows himself, has had no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">arrière
pensée</span></span> in describing this great moral and spiritual movement.
As M. Boissier has pointed out, the historian of the Antonine
age is free to treat paganism apart from the growth of the
Christian Church. The pagan world of that age seems to
have had little communication with the loftier faith which,
within a century and a half from the death of M. Aurelius,
was destined to seize the sceptre. To Juvenal, Tacitus, and
Pliny, to Plutarch, Dion Chrysostom, Lucian, and M. Aurelius,
the Church is hardly known, or known as an obscure off-shoot
of Judaism, a little sect, worshipping a <span class="tei tei-q">“crucified Sophist”</span> in
somewhat suspicious retirement, or more favourably distinguished
by simple-minded charity. The modern theologian
can hardly be content to know as little of the great movement
in the heathen world which prepared or deferred the
victory of the Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be evident to any critical reader that the scope of
this book is strictly limited. As in a former work on the
Society of the later Empire, attention has been concentrated on
the inner moral life of the time, and comparatively little space
has been given to its external history and the machinery
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of government. The relation of the Senate to the Emperor
in the first century, and the organisation of the municipal
towns have been dwelt on at some length, because they
affected profoundly the moral character of the age. On the
particular field which the writer has surveyed, Dean Merivale,
Dr. Mahaffy, Professor Bury, and Mr. Capes have thrown
much light by their learning and sympathy. But these distinguished
writers have approached the period from a different
point of view from that of the present author, and he believes
that he has not incurred the serious peril of appearing to compete
with them. He has, as a first duty, devoted himself to a complete
survey of the literature and inscriptions of the period.
References to the secondary authorities and monographs which
he has used will be found in the notes. But he owes a special
obligation to Friedländer, Zeller, Réville, Schiller, Boissier,
Martha, Peter, and Marquardt, for guidance and suggestion.
He must also particularly acknowledge his debt to M. Cumont’s
exhaustive work on the monuments of Mithra. Once more
he has to offer his warmest gratitude to his learned friend, the
Rev. Charles Plummer, Fellow of C.C.C., Oxford, for the patience
and judgment with which he has revised the proof sheets. His
thanks are also due to the Messrs. R. and R. Clark’s reader, for
the scrupulous accuracy which has saved the author much time
and labour.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The period of social history which we are about to study is
profoundly interesting in many ways, but not least in the
many contrasts between its opening and its close. It opens
with the tyranny of one of the worst men who ever occupied
a throne; it ends with the mild rule of a Stoic saint. It
begins in massacre and the carnage of civil strife; it closes
in the apparent triumph of the philosophic ideal, although
before the end of the reign of the philosophers the shadows
have begun to fall. The contrast of character between the two
princes is generally supposed to find a correspondence in the
moral character and ideals of the men over whom they ruled.
The accession of Vespasian which, after a deadly struggle, seemed
to bring the orgies of a brutal despotism to a close, is regarded
as marking not only a political, but a moral, revolution. It was
the dawn of an age of repentance and amendment, of beneficent
administration, of a great moral revival. We are bound to
accept the express testimony of a contemporary like
Tacitus,<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
who was not prone to optimist views of human progress, that
along with the exhaustion of the higher class from massacre
and reckless extravagance, the sober example of the new
emperor, and the introduction of fresh blood and purer manners
from the provinces, had produced a great moral improvement.
Even among the old noblesse, whose youth had fallen on the
age of wild licence, it is probable that a better tone asserted
itself at the beginning of what was recognised by all to be a
new order. The crushed and servile, who had easily learnt to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span><a name="Pg2" id="Pg2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>imitate the wasteful vices of their oppressors, would probably,
with equal facility, at least affect to conform to the simpler
fashions of life which Vespasian inherited from his Sabine ancestors
and the old farm-house at Reate.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The better sort, represented
by the circles of Persius, of Pliny and Tacitus, who had
nursed the ideal of Stoic or old Roman virtue in some retreat
on the northern lakes or in the folds of the Apennines, emerged
from seclusion and came to the front in the reign of Trajan.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet neither the language of Tacitus nor the testimony from
other sources justify the belief in any sudden moral revolution.
The Antonine age was undoubtedly an age of conscientious
and humane government in the interest of the subject; it was
even more an age of religious revival. But whether these
were accompanied by a corresponding elevation of conduct and
moral tone among the masses may well be doubted. On the
other hand the pessimism of satirist and historian who had
lived through the darkness of the Terror has probably
exaggerated the corruption of the evil days. If society at
large had been half as corrupt as it is represented by Juvenal,
it would have speedily perished from mere rottenness. The
Inscriptions, the Letters of the younger Pliny, even the pages
of Tacitus himself, reveal to us another world from that of
the satirist. On countless tombs we have the record or
the ideal of a family life of sober, honest industry, and pure
affection. In the calm of rural retreats in Lombardy or
Tuscany, while the capital was frenzied with vicious indulgence,
or seething with conspiracy and desolated by massacre,
there were many families living in almost puritan quietude,
where the moral standard was in many respects as high as
among ourselves. The worst period of the Roman Empire was
the most glorious age of practical Stoicism. The men of that
circle were ready, at the cost of liberty or life, to brave an
immoral tyranny; their wives were eager to follow them into
exile, or to die by their side.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> And even in the palace of Nero
there was a spotless Octavia, and slave-girls who were ready to
defend her honour at the cost of torture and death.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> In the
darkest days, the violence of the bad princes spent itself on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name="Pg3" id="Pg3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their nobles, on those whom they feared, or whom they wished
to plunder. The provinces, even under a Tiberius, a Nero, or
a Domitian, enjoyed a freedom from oppression which they
seldom enjoyed under the Republic.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> Just and upright governors
were the rule and not the exception, and even an Otho
or a Vitellius, tainted with every private vice, returned from
their provincial governments with a reputation for integrity.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
Municipal freedom and self-government were probably at their
height at the very time when life and liberty in the capital
were in hourly peril. The great Stoic doctrine of the brotherhood
and equality of men, as members of a world-wide
commonwealth, which was destined to inspire legislation in
the Antonine age, was openly preached in the reigns of Caligula
and Nero. A softer tone—a modern note of pity for the
miserable and succour for the helpless—makes itself heard in
the literature of the first century.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> The moral and mental
equality of the sexes was being more and more recognised in
theory, as the capacity of women for heroic action and self-sacrifice
was displayed so often in the age of the tyranny and
of the Stoic martyrs. The old cruelty and contempt for the
slave will not give way for many a generation; but the slave is
now treated by all the great leaders of moral reform as a being
of the same mould as his master, his equal, if not his superior,
in capacity for virtue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The peculiar distinction of the Antonine age is not to be
sought in any great difference from the age preceding it in conduct
or moral ideals among the great mass of men. Nor can
it claim any literary distinction of decided originality, except
in the possession of the airy grace and half-serious mockery
of Lucian. Juvenal, Tacitus, and the younger Pliny, Suetonius
and Quintilian, Plutarch and Dion Chrysostom, were probably all
dead before Antoninus Pius came to the throne. After Hadrian’s
reign pure Roman literature, in any worthy sense, is extinct;
it dies away in that Sahara of the higher intellect which
stretches forward to the Fall of the Empire. There is no great

The material splendour and municipal life of the Antonine
age are externally its greatest glory. It was pre-eminently a
sociable age, an age of cities. From the wall of Hadrian to
the edge of the Sahara towns sprang up everywhere with as
yet a free civic life. It was an age of engineers and architects,
who turned villages into cities and built cities in the desert,
adorned with temples and stately arches and basilicas, and
feeding their fountains from the springs of distant hills. The
rich were powerful and popular; and never had they to pay
so heavily for popularity and power. The cost of civic feasts
and games, of forums and temples and theatres, was won by
flattery, or extorted by an inexorable force of public opinion
from their coffers. The poor were feasted and amused by their
social superiors who received a deference and adulation expressed
on hundreds of inscriptions. And it must be confessed
that these records of ambitious munificence and expectant
gratitude do not raise our conception of either the economic
or the moral condition of the age.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The glory of classic art had almost vanished; and yet,
without being able to produce any works of creative genius,
the inexhaustible vitality of the Hellenic spirit once more
asserted itself. After a long eclipse, the rhetorical culture of
Greece vigorously addressed itself in the reign of Hadrian to
the conquest of the West. Her teachers and spiritual directors
indeed had long been in every family of note. Her sophists
were now seen haranguing crowds in every town from the Don
to the Atlantic. The influence of the sophistic discipline in
education will be felt in the schools of Gaul, when Visigoth
and Burgundian will be preparing to assume the heritage of
the falling Empire.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> From the early years of the second
century can be traced that great combined movement of the
Neo-Pythagorean and Platonist philosophies and the renovated
paganism which made a last stand against the conquering
Church in the reigns of Julian and Theodosius. Philosophy
became a religion, and devoted itself not only to the private
direction of character and the preaching of a higher life, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg5" id="Pg5" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the justification and unification of pagan faith. In spite
of its rather bourgeois ideal of material enjoyment and splendour,
the Antonine age, at least in its higher minds, was
an age of a purified moral sense and religious intuition. It
was, indeed, an age of spiritual contradictions. On the one
hand, not only was the old ritual of classical polytheism
scrupulously observed even by men like Plutarch and M.
Aurelius, but religious imagination was appropriating the
deities of every province, almost of every canton, embraced by
the Roman power. At the same time the fecundity of superstition
created hosts of new divinities and genii who peopled
every scene of human life.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> On the other hand syncretism
was in the air. Amid all the confused ferment of devotion
a certain principle of unity and comprehension was asserting
itself, even in popular religion. The old gods were losing
their sharp-cut individuality; the provinces and attributes of
kindred deities tended to fade into one another, and melt into
the conception of a single central Power. The religions of Egypt
and the remoter East, with their inner monotheism, supported
by the promise of sacramental grace and the hope of immortality,
came in to give impetus to the great spiritual movement.
The simple peasant might cling to his favourite god, as his
Neapolitan descendant has his favourite saint. But an Apuleius,
an Apollonius, or an Alexander Severus<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> sought a converging
spiritual support in the gods and mysteries of every clime.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Platonist philosophy strove to give rational expression to
this movement, to reconcile cultivated moral sense with the
worships of the past, to find a bond between the vagrant religious
fancies of the crowd and the remote esoteric faith of the
philosophic few. On the higher minds, from whatever quarter,
a spiritual vision had opened, which was strange to the ancient
world, the vision of One who is no longer a mere Force, but
an infinite Father, Creator, Providence and Guardian, from
whom we come, to whom we go at death. Prayer to Him is a
communion, not the means of winning mere temporal blessings;
He is not gratified by bloody sacrifice; He is dishonoured by
immoral legend.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> He cannot be imaged in gold or ivory graven
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg6" id="Pg6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by the most cunning hand, although the idealised human form
may be used as a secondary aid to devotion. These were some
of the religious ideas current among the best men, Dion Chrysostom,
Plutarch, Maximus of Tyre, which the Neo-Platonic
school strove to harmonise with the rites and legends of the
past. The means by which they tried to do so, and the measure
of their success, it is one purpose of this book to explain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Antonine age saw for a brief space the dream of Plato
realised, when kings should be philosophers, and philosophers
should be kings. Philosophy had given up its detached and
haughty reserve, or outspoken opposition to imperial power.
In the second century it lent all its forces to an authority
which in the hands of the Antonine princes seemed to answer
to its ideals.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> The votaries of the higher life, after their
persecution under the last cruel despot, rose to an influence
such as they had never wielded save in the Pythagorean aristocracies
of southern Italy. Philosophy now began to inspire
legislation and statesmanship.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> Its professors were raised to
the consulship and great prefectures. Above all, it was
incarnate, as it were, in the ruler who, whatever we may think
of his practical success, brought to the duties of government a
loftiness of spiritual detachment which has never been equalled
by any ruler of men. Whether there was any corresponding
elevation of conduct or moral tone in the mass of men may
well be doubted by any one who has studied the melancholy
thoughts of the saintly emperor. Lucian and M. Aurelius
seem to be as hopeless about the moral condition of humanity
as Seneca and Petronius were in the darkest days of Nero’s
tyranny.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> Such opinions, indeed, have little scientific value.
They are often the result of temperament and ideals, not of
trustworthy observation. But it would be rash to assume
that heightened religious feeling and the efforts of philosophy
had within a hundred years worked any wide-spread transformation
of character. It was, however, a great step in
advance that the idea of the principate, expounded by Seneca,
and the younger Pliny, as a clement, watchful, infinitely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg7" id="Pg7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>laborious earthly providence had been realised since the accession
of Trajan. It was easier to be virtuous in the reign
of M. Aurelius than in the reign of Nero, and it was especially
easier for a man of the highest social grade. The
example of the prince for good or evil must always powerfully
influence the class who are by birth or office nearest to the
throne. And bad example will be infinitely more corrupting
when it is reinforced by terror. A fierce, capricious tyranny
generates a class of vices which are perhaps more degrading
to human dignity, and socially more dangerous, than the
vices of the flesh. And the reign of such men as Caligula,
Nero, and Domitian not only stimulated the grossness of self-indulgence,
but superadded the treachery and servility of
cowardice. In order to appreciate fully what the world had
gained by the mild and temperate rule of the princes of the
second century, it is necessary to revive for a moment the
terrors of the Claudian Caesars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The power of Seneca as a moral teacher has, with some
reservations, been recognised by all the ages since his time.
But equal recognition has hardly been given to the lurid
light which he throws, in random flashes, on the moral conditions
of his class under the tyranny of Caligula and Nero.
This may be due, perhaps, to a distrust of his artificial
declamation, and that falsetto note which he too often strikes
even in his most serious moments. Yet he must be an unsympathetic
reader who does not perceive that, behind the
moral teaching of Seneca, there lies an awful experience, a lifelong
torture, which turns all the fair-seeming blessings of
life, state and luxury and lofty rank, into dust and ashes.
There is a haunting shadow over Seneca which never
draws away, which sometimes deepens into a horror of darkness.
In whatever else Seneca may have been insincere, his
veiled references to the terrors of the imperial despotism
come from the heart.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca’s life almost coincides with the Julio-Claudian
tyranny. He had witnessed in his early manhood the gloomy,
suspicious rule of Tiberius, when no day passed without an
execution,<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> when every accusation was deadly, when it might be

delation in crowds anticipated the mockery of justice by self-inflicted
death, or drank the poison even in the face of the
judges. Seneca incurred the jealous hatred of Caligula by a
too brilliant piece of rhetoric in the Senate,<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> and he has taken

evening of the cruel day, the father received an imperial command
to dine. With a face betraying no sign of emotion, he
was compelled to drink to the Emperor, while spies were eagerly
watching every expression of his face. He bore the ordeal
without flinching. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you ask why? He had another son.”</span>
Exiled to Corsica in the reign of Claudius,<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> Seneca bore the
sentence with less dignity than he afterwards met death. He
witnessed the reign of the freedmen, the infamies of Messalina,
the intrigues of Agrippina, and the treacherous murder of
Britannicus; he knew all the secrets of that ghastly court.
Installed as the tutor of the young Nero, he doubtless, if we
may judge by the treatise on Clemency, strove to inspire him
with a high ideal of monarchy as an earthly providence. He
probably at the same time discovered in the son of Cn.
Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the fatal heritage of a
vicious blood and the omens of a ghastly reign. The young
tiger was held on leash for the famous quinquennium by
Burrus and Seneca. It seemed only the device of a divine
tragic artist, by a brief space of calm and innocence, to deepen
the horror of the catastrophe. And, for Seneca, life darkened
terribly towards its close. With high purposes for the commonweal,
he had probably lent himself to doubtful means of
humouring his wayward pupil, perhaps even to crime.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> His

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca, like Tacitus, has a remarkable power of moral
diagnosis. He had acquired a profound, sad knowledge of
the pathology of the soul. It was a power which was almost
of necessity acquired in that time of terror and suspicion,
when men lived in daily peril from seeming friends. There
never was a period when men more needed the art of reading
the secrets of character. Nor was there ever a time when
there were greater facilities for the study. Life was sociable
almost to excess. The Roman noble, unless he made himself
deliberately a recluse, spent much of his time in those social
meeting-places of which we hear so often,<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> where gossip and
criticism dealt mercilessly with character, where keen wits
were pitted against one another, sometimes in a deadly game,
and where it might be a matter of life or death to pierce the
armour of dissimulation.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> Seneca had long shone in such circles.
In his later years, if he became a recluse, he was also a spiritual
director. And his Letters leave little doubt that many a restless
or weary spirit laid bare its secret misery to him, for advice or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg10" id="Pg10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>consolation. Knowing well the wildest excesses of fantastic
luxury, all the secrets of the philosophic confessional, the
miseries of a position oscillating between almost princely state
and monastic renunciation, the minister of Nero, with a self-imposed
cure of souls, had unrivalled opportunities of ascertaining
the moral condition of his class.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca is too often a rhetorician, in search of striking
effects and vivid phrase. And, like all rhetoricians, he is often
inconsistent. At times he appears to regard his own age as
having reached the very climax of insane self-indulgence. And
yet, in a calmer mood, he declares his belief that the contemporaries
of Nero were not worse than the contemporaries of
Clodius or Lucullus, that one age differs from another rather
in the greater prominence of different vices.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> His pessimism
extends to all ages which have been allured by the charm of
ingenious luxury from the simplicity of nature. In the fatal
progress of society, the artificial multiplication of human wants
has corrupted the idyllic innocence of the far-off Eden, where
the cope of heaven or the cave was the only shelter, and the
skin-clad savage made his meal on berries and slaked his thirst
from the stream.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> It is the revolutionary dream of Rousseau,
revolting from the oppression and artificial luxury of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ancien
Régime</span></span>. Seneca’s state of nature is the antithesis of the
selfish and materialised society in which he lived. Our early
ancestors were not indeed virtuous in the strict sense.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> For
virtue is the result of struggle and philosophic guidance. But
their instincts were good, because they were not tempted.

Their fierceness of energy spent itself on the beasts of the
chase. They lived peaceably in willing obedience to the
gentle paternal rule of their wisest and best, with no lust of
gold or power, no jealousy and hatred, to break a contented
and unenvious harmony. The great disturbers of this primeval
peace were avarice and luxury.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> The moment when the first

In individualist cravings men lost hold on the common wealth
of nature. Luxury entered on its downward course, in the
search for fresh food and stimulus for appetite, till merely superfluous
pleasures led on to those from which untainted nature
recoils.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> Man’s boasted conquests over nature, the triumphs

Such a theory of society has, of course, no value or interest
in itself. Its interest, like that of similar <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à priori</span></span> dreams,
lies in the light which it sheds on the social conditions which
gave it birth. Like the Germany of Tacitus, and the Social
Contract of Rousseau, Seneca’s theory of the evolution of
humanity is an oblique satire on the vices of his own age.
And not even in Tacitus or Suetonius are to be found more
ghastly revelations of a putrescent society, and the ennui and
self-loathing which capricious sensualism generates in spirits
born for something higher. It may be worth noting that the
vices which Seneca treats as most prevalent and deadly are
not so much those of sexual impurity, although they were rife
enough in his day, as those of greed, gross luxury, treacherous
and envious cruelty, the weariness of jaded nerves and exhausted
capacities of indulgence.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> It is not the coarse vices of the
Suburra, but the more deadly and lingering maladies of the
Quirinal and the Esquiline which he is describing. There is a
universal lust of gold:<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> riches are the one ornament and stay

splendid servitude.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> It had to be guarded amid perpetual
peril and envy. The universal greed and venality are worthily
matched by the endless anxiety of those who have won the
prize. Human life has become a scene of cruel and selfish
egotism, a ferocious struggle of beasts of prey, eager for rapine,
and heedless of those who go down in the obscene struggle.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>
It is an age when men glorify the fortunate and trample on
the fallen. The cunning and cruelty of the wild beast on the

armour of hypocrisy there is always ready the rack, the
poisoned cup, the order for self-murder. It is characteristic
of the detachment of Seneca that he sees the origin of this
hateful tyranny. No modern has more clearly discerned the
far-reaching curse of slavery.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> Every great house is a
miniature of the Empire under a Caligula or Nero, a nursery
of pretenders capable of the same enormities. The unchecked
power of the master, which could, for the slightest faults, an ill-swept
pavement, an unpolished dish, or a sullen look, inflict the
most brutal torture,<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> produced those cold hearts which gloated
over the agony of gallant men in the arena, and applauded
in the Senate the tyrant’s latest deed of blood. And the
system of household slavery enervated character while it made
it heartless and cruel. The Inscriptions confirm Seneca’s
picture of the minute division of functions among the household,
to anticipate every possible need or caprice of the master.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a>
Under such a system the master became a helpless dependent.
There is real truth, under some ludicrous exaggeration, in the
tale of a Roman noble, taking his seat in his sedan after the
bath, and requiring the assurance of his slave that he was

gathered in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">circuli</span></span>,<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> to hear and spread the wildest rumours
about the army on the frontier, to kill a woman’s reputation
with a hint, to find a sinister meaning in some imperial order,
or to gloat in whispers over the last highly-coloured tale of
folly or dark guilt from the palace. It was a perilous enjoyment,
for, with a smiling face, some seeming friend was probably
noting every hint which might be tortured into an
accusation before the secret tribunal on the Palatine, or
angling for a sneer which might cost its author a fortune, or
send him to the rocks of Gyarus.

In reading Seneca’s writings, especially those of his last
years, you are conscious of a horror which hardly ever takes
definite shape, a thick stifling air, as it were, charged with
lightning. Again and again, you feel a dim terror closing in
silently and stealthily, with sudden glimpses of unutterable
torture, of cord and rack and flaming tunic.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> You seem to see
the sage tossing on his couch of purple under richly <a name="corr13" id="corr13" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">panelled</span>
ceilings of gold, starting at every sound in the wainscot,<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> as he
awaits the messenger of death. It is not so much that
Seneca fears death itself, although we may suspect that his
nerves sometimes gave the lie to his principles. He often
hails death as welcome at any age, as the deliverer who strikes
off the chain and opens the prison door, the one harbour on a
tempestuous and treacherous sea.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> He is grateful for having
always open this escape from life’s long torture, and boldly
claims the right to anticipate the executioner. The gloom of
Seneca seems rather to spring from a sense of the terrible con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg14" id="Pg14" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trast between wealth and state and an ignominious doom which
was ever ready to fall. And to his fevered eye all stately rank
seems at last but a precipice overhanging the abyss, a mark for
treacherous envy or the spitefulness of Fortune.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“A great
fortune is a great servitude,”</span><a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> which, if it has been hard to
win, is harder still to guard. And all life is full of these
pathetic contrasts. Pleasure is nearest neighbour to pain; the
summer sea in a moment is boiling in the tempest; the labour
of long years is scattered in a day; there is always terror lurking
under our deepest peace. And so we reach the sad gospel of
a universal pessimism; <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing is so deceitful and treacherous
as the life of man.”</span><a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> No one would knowingly accept such a
fatal gift, of which the best that can be said is that the torture
is short, that our first moment of existence is the first stage to
the grave.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> Thus to Seneca, with all his theoretical indifference
to things external to the virtuous will, with all his admiration
for the invulnerable wisdom, withdrawn in the inner citadel of
the soul, and defying the worst that tyrants or fortune could
inflict, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">taedium vitae</span></span> became almost unendurable. The
interest of all this lies, not in Seneca’s inconsistency, but in the
nightmare which brooded on such minds in the reign of Nero.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Something of the gloom of Seneca was part of the evil
heritage of a class, commanding inexhaustible wealth and
assailed by boundless temptations to self-indulgence, which
had been offered by the conquest of East and West. The
weary senses failed to respond to the infinite sensual seductions
which surrounded the Roman noble from his earliest years.
If he did not succeed in squandering his fortune, he often
exhausted too early his capacity for healthy joy in life, and
the nemesis of sated appetite and disillusionment too surely
cast its shadow over his later years. Prurient slander was
rife in those days, and we are not bound to accept all its
tales about Seneca. Yet there are passages in his writings
which leave the impression that, although he may have
cultivated a Pythagorean <a name="corr14" id="corr14" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">asceticism</span> in his youth,<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> he did not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg15" id="Pg15" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>altogether escape the taint of his time.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> His enormous
fortune did not all come by happy chance or the bounty of
the emperor.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> His gardens and palace, with all its priceless
furniture, must have been acquired because at one time he
felt pleasure in such luxuries. A soul so passionate in its
renunciation may, according to laws of human nature, have
been once as passionate in indulgence. In his case, as so
often in the history of the Church, the saint may have had a
terrible repentance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is probable, however, that this pessimism is more the
result of the contrast between Seneca’s ideal of the principate,
and the degradation of its power in the hands of his pupil
Nero. Seneca may have been regarded once as a possible
candidate for the throne, but he was no conspirator or revolutionary.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>
He would have condemned the visionaries
whose rudeness provoked even the tolerant Vespasian.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> In a
letter, which must have been written during the Neronian
terror, he emphatically repudiates the idea that the votaries of
philosophy are refractory subjects. Their great need is quiet
and security. They should surely reverence him who, by his
sleepless watch, guards what they most value, just as, on a
merchantman, the owner of the most precious part of the
cargo will be most grateful for the protection of the god
of the sea.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> Seneca would have his philosophic brethren
give no offence by loud self-assertion or a parade of superior
wisdom.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> In that deceitful dawn of his pupil’s reign, Seneca
had written a treatise in which he had striven to charm him
by the ideal of a paternal monarchy, in the consciousness of
its god-like power ever delighting in mercy and pity, tender to
the afflicted, gentle even to the criminal. It is very much the
ideal of Pliny and Dion Chrysostom under the strong and
temperate rule of Trajan.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> Addressed to one of the worst
emperors, it seems, to one looking back, almost a satire. Yet
we should remember that, strange as it may seem, Nero,
with all his wild depravity, appears to have had a strange
charm for many, even to the end. The men who trembled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg16" id="Pg16" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>under the sombre and hypocritical Domitian, regretted the
wild gaiety and bonhomie of Nero, and each spring, for
years after his death, flowers were laid by unknown hands
upon his grave.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> The charm of boyhood, with glimpses of
some generous instincts, may for a time have deceived even
the experienced man of the world and the brooding analyst of
character. But it is more probable that the piece is rather a
warning than a prophecy. Seneca had watched all the caprices
of an imperial tyrant, drunk with a sense of omnipotence,
having in his veins the maddening taint of ancestral vice,<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>
with nerves unstrung by maniacal excesses, brooding in the vast
solitudes of the Palatine till he became frenzied with terror,
striking down possible rivals, at first from fear or greed,<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> in the
end from the wild beast’s lust for blood, and the voluptuary’s
delight in suffering. The prophecy of the father as to the
future of Agrippina’s son<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> found probably an echo in the fears
of his tutor. But, in spite of his forebodings, Seneca thought
the attempt to save him worth making. He first appeals to
his imagination. Nero has succeeded to a vicegerency of God
on earth.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> He is the arbiter of life and death, on whose word
the fortunes of citizens, the happiness or misery of whole
peoples depend.  His innocence raises the highest hopes.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
But the imperial task is heavy, and its perils are appalling.
The emperor is the one bond by which the world-empire is
held together;<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> he is its vital breath. Man, the hardest of all
animals to govern,<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> can only be governed long by love, and love
can only be won by beneficence and gentleness to the frowardness
of men. In his god-like place, the prince should imitate
the mercy of the gods.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> Wielding illimitable power, he is yet
the servant of all, and cannot usurp the licence of the private
subject. He is like one of the heavenly orbs, bound by inevitable
law to move onward in a fixed orbit, unswerving and
unresting. If he relies on cruel force, rather than on
clemency, he will sink to the level of the tyrant and meet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg17" id="Pg17" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his proper fate.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> Cruelty in a king only multiplies his
enemies and envenoms hatred. In that fatal path there is no
turning back. The king, once dreaded by his people, loses
his nerve and strikes out blindly in self-defence.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> The
atmosphere of treachery and suspicion thickens around him,
and, in the end, what, to his maddened mind, seemed at first a
stern necessity becomes a mere lust for blood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been suggested that Seneca was really, to some extent,
the cause of the grotesque or tragic failure of Nero.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> The
rhetorical spirit, which breathes through all Seneca’s writings,
may certainly be an evil influence in the education of a ruler
of men. The habit of playing with words, of aiming at
momentary effect, with slight regard to truth, may inspire the
excitable vanity of the artist, but is hardly the temper for
dealing with the hard problems of government. And the
dazzling picture of the boundless power of a Roman emperor,
which Seneca put before his pupil, in order to heighten his
sense of responsibility, might intoxicate a mind naturally prone
to grandiose visions, while the sober lesson would be easily
forgotten. The spectacle of <span class="tei tei-q">“the kingdoms of the world and
all the glory of them”</span> at his feet was a dangerous temptation
to a temperament like Nero’s.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> Arrogance and cruelty were
in the blood of the Domitii. Nero’s grandfather, when only
aedile, had compelled the censor to give place to him; he
had produced Roman matrons in pantomime, and given gladiatorial
shows with such profusion of cruelty, as to shock that
not very tender-hearted age.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> The father of the emperor, in
addition to crimes of fraud, perjury, and incest, had, in the
open forum, torn out the eye of a Roman knight, and deliberately
trampled a child under his horse’s feet on the Appian
Way.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> Yet such is the strange complexity of human nature,
that Nero seems by nature not to have been destitute of some
generous and amiable qualities. We need not lay too much
stress on the innocence ascribed to him by Seneca.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> Nor need
we attribute to Nero’s initiative the sound or benevolent measures
which characterised the beginning of his reign. But he showed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg18" id="Pg18" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at one time some industry and care in performing his judicial
work.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> He saw the necessity, in the interests of public health
and safety, of remodelling the narrow streets and mean insanitary
dwellings of Rome.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> His conception of the Isthmian
canal, if the engineering problem could have been conquered,
would have been an immense boon to traders with the Aegean.
Even his quinquennial festival, inspired by the Greek contests
in music and gymnastic,<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> represented a finer ideal of such gatherings,
which was much needed by a race devoted to the coarse
realism of pantomime and the butchery of the arena. Fierce and
incalculably capricious as he could be, Nero, at his best, had
also a softer side. He had a craving for love and appreciation<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>;
some of his cruelty was probably the revenge for the denial
of it. He was singularly patient of lampoons and invective
against himself.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> Although he could be brutal in his treatment
of women, he also knew how to inspire real affection, and perhaps
in a few cases return it. He seems to have had something of
real love for Acte, his mistress. His old nurses consoled him
in his last hour of agony, and, along with the faithful Acte,
laid the last of his race in the vault of the Domitii.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> Nero
must have had something of that charm which leads women in
every age to forget faults, and even crimes in the men whom
they have once loved. And the strange, lingering superstition,
which disturbed the early Church, and which looked for his
reappearance down to the eleventh century, could hardly have
gathered around an utterly mean and mediocre character.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Nero uttered the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Qualis artifex pereo,”</span><a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> he
gave not only his own interpretation of his life, he also revealed
one great secret of its ghastly failure. It may be admitted
that Nero had a certain artistic enthusiasm, a real ambition to
excel.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> He painted with some skill, he composed verses not
without a certain grace. In spite of serious natural defects,
he took endless pains to acquire the technique of a singer.
Far into the night he would sit in rapt enthusiasm listening to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg19" id="Pg19" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the effects of Terpnus, and trying to copy them.<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> His artistic
tour in Greece, which lowered him so much in the eyes of the
West, was really inspired by the passion to find a sympathetic
audience which he could not find at Rome. And, in spite of
his arrogance and vanity, he had a wholesome deference for the
artistic judgment of Greece. Yet it is very striking that in the
records of his reign, the most damning accusation is that he
disgraced the purple by exhibitions on the stage. His songs
to the lyre, his impersonation of the parturient Canace or the
mad Hercules, did as much to cause his overthrow as his
murders of Britannicus and Agrippina.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> The stout Roman
soldier and the Pythagorean apostle have the same scorn
for the imperial charioteer and actor. A false literary
ambition, born of a false system of education, was the bane
of Roman culture for many ages. The dilettante artist on
the throne in the first century had many a successor in the
literary arts among the grand seigneurs of the fifth. They
could play with their ingenious tricks of verse in sight of
the Gothic camp-fires. He could contend for the wreath at
Olympia when his faithful freedman was summoning him
back by the news that the West was seething with revolt.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nero’s mother had dissuaded him from the study of philosophy;
his tutor debarred him from the study of the manly
oratory of the great days.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> The world was now to learn the
meaning of a false artistic ambition, divorced from a sense
of reality and duty. Aestheticism may be only a love of
sensational effects, with no glimpse of the ideal. It may be
a hypocritical materialism, screening itself under divine names.
In this taste Nero was the true representative of his age. It
was deeply tainted with that mere passion for the grandiose
and startling, and for feverish intellectual effects, which a true
culture spurns as a desecration of art.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> Mere magnitude and
portentousness, the realistic expression of physical agony, the
coarse flush of a half-sensual pleasure, captivated a vulgar
taste, to which crapulous excitement and a fever of the

prejudices of the Roman. And yet he was in some respects
in thorough sympathy with the masses. His lavish games
and spectacles atoned to some extent for his aberrations of
Hellenism. He was generous and wasteful, and he encouraged
waste in others,<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> and waste is always popular till the bill has
to be paid. He was a <span class="tei tei-q">“cupitor incredibilium.”</span><a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> The province

Explorers were sent to pierce the mysterious barrier of the
Caucasus, and discover the secret sources of the Nile. He had
great engineering schemes which might seem baffling even to
modern skill, and which almost rivalled the wildest dreams of
the lunatic brain of Caligula.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> His Golden House, in a park
stretching from the Palatine to the heights of the Esquiline,
was on a scale of more than oriental magnificence. At last
the master of the world was properly lodged. With colonnades
three miles long, with its lakes and pastures and sylvan glades,
it needed only a second Nero in Otho to dream of adding to
its splendour.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> To such a prince the astrologers might well

thinking so. He was born into a circle which believed chiefly
in <span class="tei tei-q">“the lust of the eye and the pride of life.”</span> He formed a
circle many of whom perished in the carnage of Bedriacum.
With a treasury drained by insane profusion, Nero resorted to
rapine and judicial murder to replenish it.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> The spendthrift

The artistic treasures of Greece were carried off by the votary
of Greek art; the gold and silver images of her shrines were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg21" id="Pg21" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sent to the melting-pot.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a> Ungrateful testators paid their due
penalty after death; and delation, watching every word or
gesture, skilfully supplied the needed tale of victims for plunder.
It is all a hackneyed story. Yet it is perhaps necessary to
revive it once more to explain the suppressed terror and
lingering agony of the last days of Seneca.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The impressions of the Terror which we receive from
Seneca are powerful and almost oppressive. A thick atmosphere
of gloom and foreboding seems to stifle us as we turn
his pages. But Seneca deals rather in shadowy hint and
veiled suggestion than in definite statement. For the minute
picture of that awful scene of degradation we must turn to
Tacitus. He wrote in the fresh dawn of an age of fancied
freedom, when the gloom of the tyranny seemed to have
suddenly vanished like an evil dream. Yet he cannot shake
off the sense of horror and disgust which fifteen years of
ignoble compliance or silent suffering have burnt into his soul.
Even under the manly, tolerant rule of Trajan, he hardly seems
to have regained his breath.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> He can scarcely believe that
the light has come at last. His attitude to the tyranny is
essentially different from that of Seneca. The son of the
provincial from Cordova views the scene rather as the cosmopolitan
moralist, imperilled by his huge fortune and the
neighbourhood of the terrible palace. Tacitus looks at it as
the Roman Senator, steeped in all old Roman tradition, caring
little for philosophy, but caring intensely for old Roman dignity
and the prestige of that great order, which he had seen humbled
and decimated.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> The feeling of Seneca is that of a Stoic monk,
isolated in a corner of his vast palace, now trembling before
the imperial jealousy, which his wealth and celebrity may
draw down upon him, and again seeking consolation in
thoughts of God and eternity which might often seem to
belong to Thomas à Kempis. The tone of Tacitus is sometimes
that of a man who should have lived in the age of the
Samnite or the Carthaginian wars, before luxury and factious
ambition had sapped the moral strength of the great aristocratic
caste, while his feelings are divided between grim anger at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg22" id="Pg22" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a cruel destiny, and scornful regret for the weakness and the
self-abandonment of a class which had been once so great.
The feelings of Seneca express themselves rather in rhetorical
self-pity. The feelings of Tacitus find vent in words which
sometimes veil a pathos too proud for effusive utterance, sometimes
cut like lancet points, and which, in their concentrated
moral scorn, have left an eternal brand of infamy on names
of historic renown.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
More than forty years had passed between the date of
Seneca’s last letters to Lucilius and the entry of Tacitus on his
career as a historian.<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> He was a child when Seneca died.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>
His life is known to us only from a few stray glimpses in the
Letters of Pliny,<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> eked out by the inferences of modern
erudition. As a young boy, he must have often heard the
tales of the artistic follies and the orgies of Nero, and the
ghastly cruelties of the end of his reign. As a lad of fifteen, he
may have witnessed something of the carnival of blood and
lust which appropriately closed the régime of the Julio-Claudian
line. He entered on his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cursus honorum</span></span> in the reign
of Vespasian, and attained the praetorship under Domitian.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>
A military command probably withdrew him from Rome for
three years during the tyranny of the last Flavian.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> He was
consul suffectus in 97, and then held the proconsulship of Asia.
It cannot be doubted from his own words that, as a senator,
he had to witness tamely the Curia beset with soldiery, the
noblest women driven into exile, and men of the highest rank
and virtue condemned to death on venal testimony in the secret
tribunal of the Alban Palace. His hand helped to drag
Helvidius to the dungeon, and was stained with the blood of
Senecio. He lived long enough under a better prince to
leave an unfading picture of the tragedy of solitary and
remorseless power, but not long enough to forget the horrors
and degradation through which he had passed.

The claim of Tacitus to have been uninfluenced by passion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg23" id="Pg23" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or partiality<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> has been disputed by a modern school of critics.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a>
Sometimes, from a love of Caesarism and strong government,
sometimes from the scholarly weakness for finding a new
interpretation of history, the great historic painter of the
Julio-Claudian despotism has been represented as an acrid
rhetorician of the Senatorial reaction, a dreamer who looks
back wistfully to the old Republic, belonging to one of those
haughty circles of the old régime which were always in chronic
revolt, which lived in an atmosphere of suspicion and poisonous
gossip, and nourished its dreams and hatreds till fiction
and fact melted into one another in gloomy retrospect.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> He
is the great literary avenger of the Senate after its long
sanguinary conflict with the principate, using the freedom of
the new order to blacken the character of princes who had
been forced, in the interests of the world-wide empire, to fight
and to crush a selfish and narrow-minded caste.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The weakness of all such estimates of Tacitus lies in their
failure to recognise the complex nature of the man, the
mingled and crossing influences of training, official experience,
social environment, and lofty moral ideals<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>; it lies even more
in a misconception of his aims as a historian. Tacitus was a
great orator, and the spirit of the rhetorical school, combined
with the force and dexterity of style which it could communicate,
left the greatest Roman historians with a less
rigorous sense of truth than their weakest modern successors
often possess.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> No Roman ever rose to the Thucydidean
conception of history. Moreover Tacitus, although originally
not of the highest social rank,<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> belonged to the aristocratic
class by sympathy and associations. Like Suetonius, he
necessarily drew much of his information from the memories
of great houses and the tales of the elders who had lived
through the evil days.<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> He acquired thus many of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg24" id="Pg24" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prejudices of a class which, from its history, and still more
from its education, sought its ideals in the past rather than
in the future. He mingled in those circles, which in every
age disguise the meanness and bitterness of gossip by the
airy artistic touch of audacious wit, polished in many social
encounters. He had himself witnessed the triumph of delation
and the cold cruelty of Domitian. He had shared in
the humiliation of the Senate which had been cowed into
acquiescence in his worst excesses. And the spectacle had
inspired him with a horror of unchecked power in the hands
of a bad man, and a gloomy distrust of that human nature
which could sink to such ignoble servility.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> Yet on the
other hand Tacitus had gained practical experience in high
office, both as soldier and administrator, which has always a
sobering effect on the judgment. He realised the difficulties
of government and the unreasonableness of ordinary men.
Hence he has no sympathy with a doctrinaire and chimerical
opposition even under the worst government.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> However much
he might respect the high character of the philosophic
enthusiasts of the day, he distrusted their theatrical defiance
of power, and he threw his shield over a discreet reserve,
which could forget that it was serving a tyrant in serving
the commonwealth.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> Tacitus may at times express himself
with a stern melancholy bitterness, which might at first
seem to mark him as a revolutionary dreamer, avenging an
outraged political ideal. Such an interpretation would be a
grave mistake, which he would himself have been the first to
correct. The ideal which he is avenging is not a political,
but a moral ideal.<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> The bitter sadness is that of the profound
analyst of character, with a temperament of almost feverish
intensity and nervous force. The interest of history to
Thucydides and Polybius lies in the political lessons which
it may teach posterity. Its interest to Tacitus lies in the
discovery of hidden motives and the secret of character, in
watching the stages of an inevitable degeneracy, the moral
preparation for a dark, inglorious end. And the analyst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg25" id="Pg25" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was a curiously vivid painter of character, the character of
individuals, of periods, and of peoples. His portraits burn
themselves into the imaginative memory, so that the impression,
once seized, can never be lost. Tiberius and Claudius
and Nero, Messalina and Agrippina, in spite of the most
mordant criticism, will live for ever as they have been
portrayed by the fervid imagination of Tacitus. Nor is he
less searching and vivid in depicting the collective feeling
and character of masses of men. We watch the alternating
fury and repentance of the mutinous legions of Germanicus,<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>
or the mingled fierceness and sorrow with which they
wandered among the bleaching bones on the lost battlefield
of Varus,<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> or the passion of grief and admiration with which
the praetorian cohorts kissed the self-inflicted wounds of
Otho.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> Or, again, we follow the changing moods of the
Roman populace, passing from anger and grief to short-lived
joy, and then to deep silent sorrow, at the varying rumours
from the East about the health of Germanicus.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> In Tacitus
events are nearly always seen in their moral setting. The
misery and shame of the burning of the Capitol by the
Vitellians are heightened by the thought that the catastrophe
is caused by the madness of civil strife.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> In the awful
conflict which raged from street to street, the horror consists
in the mixture of cruelty and licence. The baths and
brothels and taverns are crowded at the very hour when the
neighbouring ways are piled with corpses and running with
blood; the rush of indulgence paused not for a moment; men
seemed to revel in the public disasters. There was bloodshed
enough in the days of Cinna and Sulla, but the world
was at least spared such a carnival of lust.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> Even in
reporting or imagining the speech of Galgacus to his warriors
on the Grampians,<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> even in the pictures of the German
tribes,<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> the ethical interest is always foremost. The cruel
terror of the prince, the effeminacy and abandoned adulation
of the nobles, the grossness and fierceness of the masses,
contrasted with the loyalty, chastity, and hardihood of the
German clans, seem to have dimly foreshadowed to Tacitus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg26" id="Pg26" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a danger from which all true Romans averted their eyes till
the end.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The key to the interpretation of Tacitus is to regard him
as a moralist rather than a politician. And he is a moralist
with a sad, clinging pessimism.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> He is doomed to be the

pessimist theory of evolution. The early equality and peace and
temperance have been lost through a steady growth of greed
and egotistic ambition.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> It is in the past we must seek our
ideals; it is from the past we derive our strength. With
the same gloomy view of his contemporaries as M. Aurelius
had,<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> he holds vaguely a similar view of cycles in human
affairs.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> And probably the fairest hope which ever visited the
mind of Tacitus was that of a return to the simplicity of a long
gone age. He hailed the accession of Vespasian and of Trajan
as a happy change to purer manners and to freedom of speech.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>
But the reign of Vespasian had been followed by the gloomy
suspicious despotism of Domitian. Who could be sure about
the successors of Trajan? Tacitus hardly shared the enthusiasm
and exuberant hopes expressed by his friend Pliny in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span>. It was a natural outbreak of joy at escaping from
the dungeon, and the personal character of Trajan succeeded
in partially veiling the overwhelming force of the emperor
under the figment of the freely accepted rule of the first citizen.
Tacitus no doubt felt as great satisfaction as his friend at the
suppression of the informers, the restored freedom of speech,
the recovered dignity of the Senate, the prince’s respect for old
republican forms and etiquette.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> He felt probably even keener
pleasure that virtue and talent had no longer to hide themselves
from a jealous eye, and that the whole tone of society
was being raised by the temperate example of the emperor.
But he did not share Pliny’s illusions as to the prince’s altered
position under the new régime. The old Republic was gone
for ever.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> It was still the rule of one man, on whose character
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg27" id="Pg27" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>everything depended. He would never have joined Plutarch
and Dion in exalting the emperor to the rank of vicegerent
of God. With his experience and psychologic skill, he
was bound to regard all solitary power as a terrible danger
both to its holder and his subjects.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Capax imperii, nisi
imperasset”</span> condenses a whole disquisition on imperialism.
In truth, Tacitus, like many thoughtful students of politics,
had little faith in mere political forms and names.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> They are
often the merest imposture: they depend greatly on the spirit
and social tone which lie behind them. In the abstract,
perhaps, Tacitus would have given a preference to aristocracy.
But he saw how easily it might pass into a selfish despotism.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a>
He had no faith in the people or in popular government, with
its unstable excitability. He admitted that the conquests of
Rome, egotistic ambition, and the long anarchy of the Civil
Wars had made the rule of one inevitable. But monarchy
easily glides into tyranny, and he accepts the Empire only as a
perilous necessity which may be justified by the advent of a
good prince. The hereditary succession, which had been grafted
on the principate of Augustus, had inflicted on the world a
succession of fools or monsters. The only hope lay in elevating
the standard of virtue, and in the choice of a worthy successor
by the forms of adoption.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> The one had in his own time given
the world a Domitian, and was destined within three generations
to give it a Commodus. The other secured to it the peace and
order of the age of which Tacitus saw the dawn.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The motive of Tacitus was essentially ethical, and his moral
standard was in many respects lofty. Yet his standard was
sometimes limited by the prejudices of his class. He cherished
the old Roman ideal of <span class="tei tei-q">“virtus”</span> rather than the Stoic gospel
of a cosmopolitan brotherhood of man.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> Like Pliny, he felt
little horror at gladiatorial combats,<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> although he may have had
a certain contempt for the rage for them. He had probably
far less humane feelings than Pliny on the subject of slavery.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg28" id="Pg28" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>While he admired many of the rude virtues of the Germans,
he prayed Heaven that their tribal blood-feuds might last for

blood and breeding. He feels a proud satisfaction in recording

great traditions moves his indignant pity.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> He sometimes

revolution which was raising the freedman, the petty trader,
the obscure provincial, to the top, he probably regarded with
something of Juvenal’s suspicion and dislike. The new man
would have needed a fine character, or a great record of service,
to commend him to Tacitus.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> But, with all these defects of
hard and narrow prejudice, Tacitus maintains a lofty ideal of
character, a severe enthusiasm for the great virtues which are
the salt of every society.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the early nurture of Tacitus nothing is directly known.
But we may be permitted to imagine him tenderly yet strictly
guarded from the taint of slave nurses<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a> by a mother who was
as unspotted as Julia Procilla, the mother of his hero Agricola.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>
What importance he attached to this jealous care of a good
woman, what a horror he had of the incitements to cruelty
and lust which surrounded the young Roman from his cradle,
are to be traced in many a passage coming from the heart. His
ideal of youthful chastity and of the pure harmony of a single
wedded union, reveals to us another world from the scene of
heartless, vagrant intrigue, on which Ovid wasted his brilliant
gifts. His taste, if not his principles, revolted against the coarse
seductions of the spectacles and the wasteful grossness of the
banquets of his time.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a> He envies the Germans their freedom
from these great corrupters of Roman character, from the lust
for gold, and the calculating sterility which cut itself from
nature’s purest pleasure, to be surrounded on the deathbed by a
crowd of hungry, shameless sycophants. While Tacitus had a
burning contempt for the nerveless cowardice and sluggishness
which degraded so many of his order,<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> he may have valued
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg29" id="Pg29" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even to excess, although it is hardly possible to do so, the
virtues of the strenuous soldier. Proud submission to authority,
proud, cold endurance in the face of cruel hardship and
enormous odds, readiness to sacrifice even life at the call of
the State, must always tower over the safe aspirations of
an untried virtue. The soldier, though he never knows it,
is the noblest of idealists. The ideal of Tacitus, although he
sees his faults of temper,<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> was probably the character of his
father-in-law, Agricola, grave, earnest and severe, yet with a
mingled clemency, free from all vulgar avarice or ostentation
of rank, from all poisonous jealousy, an eager ambitious warrior,
yet one knowing well how to temper audacious energy with
prudence.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> Tacitus would probably have sought his ideal
among those grey war-worn soldiers on a dangerous frontier,
half warrior and half statesman, just and clement, stern in
discipline, yet possessing the secret of the Roman soldier’s love,
the men who were guarding the Solway, the Rhine, and the
Danube, while their brethren in the Senate were purchasing
their lives or their ease by adulation and treachery. Yet, after
all, Tacitus was too great for such a limited ideal. He could
admire faith and courage and constancy in any rank.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> With
profound admiration and subdued pathos, he tells how the
freedwoman Epicharis, racked and fainting in every limb with
the extremity of torture, refused to tell the secret of the
Pisonian conspiracy, and by a voluntary death shamed the
knights and nobles who were ready to betray their nearest
kin.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> The slave girls of the empress, who defiantly upheld

The deepest feeling of Tacitus about the early Empire
seems to have been that it was fatal to character both in
prince and subject. This conviction he has expressed with the
burning intensity of the artist. He could never have penned
one of those laborious paragraphs of Suetonius which seem
transcribed from a carefully kept note-book, with a lifeless
catalogue of the vices, the virtues, and the eccentricities of the
subject. For Tacitus, history is a living and real thing, not a
matter of mere antiquarian interest. He has seen a single
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg30" id="Pg30" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lawless will, unchecked by constitutional restraints or ordinary
human feeling, making sport of the lives and fortunes of men.
He has seen the sons of the proudest houses selling their
ancestral honour for their lives, betraying their nearest and
dearest, and kissing the hand which was reeking with innocent
blood.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> When he looked back, he saw that, for more than
fifteen years, with brief intervals, virtue had been exiled or
compelled to hide itself in impotent seclusion, and that power
and wealth had been the reward of perfidy and grovelling self-abasement.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>
The brooding silence of those years of humiliating
servitude did not extinguish the faith of Tacitus in human
virtue, but it almost extinguished his faith in a righteous God.
Tacitus is no philosopher, with either a reasoned théodicée or a
consistent repudiation of faith.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> He uses popular language
about religion, and often speaks like an old Roman in all things
touching the gods.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> He is, moreover, often as credulous as
he is sceptical in his treatment of omens and oracles.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> But,
with all his intense faith in goodness, the spectacle of the world
of the Caesars has profoundly shaken his trust in the Divine
justice. Again and again, he attributes the long agony of the
Roman world to mere chance or fate,<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> or the anger of Heaven,
as well as to the madness of men.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> Sometimes he almost
denies a ruling power which could permit the continuance of
the crimes of a Nero.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> Sometimes he grimly notes its impartial
treatment of the good and the evil.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> And again, he speaks of
the Powers who visit not to protect, but only to avenge. And
so, by a curse like that which haunted the Pelopidae in tragic
legend, the monarchy, cradled in ambition and civil strife, has
gone on corrupting and corrupted. The lust of despotic power
which Tacitus regards as the fiercest and most insatiable of
human passions, has been intensified by the spectacle of a
monarchy commanding, with practically unlimited sway, the
resources and the fortunes of a world.</p>

It was a dazzling prize, offering frightful temptations both
to the holder and to possible rivals and pretenders. The day
on which a Nero or a Caligula awoke to all the possibilities of
power was a fateful one. And Tacitus, with the instinct of
the tragic artist, has painted the steady, fatal corruption of
a prince’s character by the corroding influence of absolute and
solitary sway. Of all the Caesars down to his time, the
only one who changed for the better was the homely Vespasian.
In Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero, some of this deterioration of
character must be set down to the morbid strain in the Julio-Claudian
line, with its hard and cruel pride, and its heritage
of a tainted blood, of which Nero’s father knew the secret so
well. Much was also due to the financial exhaustion which,
in successive reigns, followed the most reckless waste. It
would be difficult to say whether the emperors or their nobles
were the most to blame for the example of spendthrift extravagance
and insane luxury. Two generations before the foundation
of the Empire, the passion for profusion had set in, which,
according to Tacitus, raged unchecked till the accession of
Vespasian.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a> Certainly, the man who would spend £3000 on
a myrrhine vase, £4000 on a table of citrus-wood, or £40,000
on a richly wrought carpet from Babylon, had little to learn
even from Nero.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> Yet the example of an emperor must always
be potent for good or evil. We have the testimony of Pliny
and Claudian,<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> separated by an interval of three hundred years,
that the world readily conforms its life to that of one man,
if that man is head of the State. Nero’s youthful enthusiasm
for declamation gave an immense impulse to the passion for
rhetoric.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> His enthusiasm for acting and music spread through
all ranks, and the emperor’s catches were sung at wayside
inns.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> M. Aurelius made philosophy the mode, and the Stoic
Emperor is responsible for some of the philosophic imposture
which moved the withering scorn of Lucian. The Emperor’s
favourite drug grew so popular that the price of it became
almost prohibitory.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> If the model of Vespasian’s homely habits
had such an effect in reforming society, we may be sure that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg32" id="Pg32" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the evil example of his spendthrift predecessors did at least
as much to deprave it.

And what an example it was! The extravagance of the
Claudian Caesars and the last Flavian has become a piece of
historic commonplace. Every one has heard of the unguent
baths of Caligula, his draughts of melted pearls, his galleys
with jewel-studded sterns and gardens and orchards on their
decks, his viaduct connecting the Palatine with the Capitoline,
his bridge from Bauli to Puteoli, and many another scheme
of that wild brain, which had in the end to be paid for in

But the great imperial spendthrifts resorted to more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg33" id="Pg33" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>simple and primitive methods of replenishing their coffers.
Self-indulgent waste is often seen linked with meanness
and hard cruelty. The epigram of Suetonius on Domitian,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inopia rapax, metu saevus</span></span>,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> sums up the sordid history of
the tyranny. The cool biographer of Caligula, Nero, and
Domitian, when in his methodical fashion, he has recorded
their financial difficulties, immediately proceeds to describe
the unblushing rapine or ingenious chicanery by which the
needy tyrants annexed a coveted estate. The emperors now
generally protected the provinces from plunder,<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> but they
applied all the Verrine methods to their own nobles. It was
not hard with the help of the sleuth hounds who always
gather round the despot, to find plausible grounds of accusation.
The vague law of majesty, originally intended to guard
the security of the commonwealth, was now used to throw its
protection around the sacrosanct prince in whom all the highest
powers of government were concentrated.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> The slightest suspicion
of disloyalty or discontent, the most insignificant act
or word, which a depraved ingenuity could misinterpret, was
worked up into a formidable indictment by men eager for
their share of the plunder. To have written the memoir of a
Stoic saint or kept the birthday of a dead emperor, to possess
an imperial horoscope or a map of the world, to call a slave
by the name of Hannibal or a dish by that of Lucullus, might
become a fatal charge.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ungrateful testators”</span> who had

accusations were easily obtained in the Rome of the early
Caesars. Life was eminently sociable. A great part of the day
was spent at morning receptions, in the Forum, the Campus
Martius, the barber’s or bookseller’s shops, or in the colonnades
where crowds of fashionable idlers gathered to relieve the
tedium of life by gossip and repartee. It was a city, says
Tacitus, which knew everything and talked of everything.<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>
Never was curiosity more eager or gossip more reckless. Men
were almost ready to risk their lives for a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bon mot</span></span>. And in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg34" id="Pg34" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>reign of Nero or Domitian, the risk was a very real one.
The imperial espionage, of which Maecenas in Dion Cassius
recognised at once the danger and the necessity,<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> was an
organised system even under the most blameless emperors
It can be traced in the reigns of Nerva, Hadrian, and
Antoninus Pius.<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> But under the tyrants, voluntary informers
sprang up in every class. Among the hundreds of
slaves attached to a great household, there were in such times
sure to be spies, attracted by the lure of freedom and a
fortune, who might report and distort what they had observed
in their master’s unguarded hours. Men came to dread possible
traitors even among their nearest of kin, among their
closest friends of the highest rank.<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> Who can forget the
ignominy of those three Senators, one of them bearing the
historic name of Cato, who, to win the consulship from
Sejanus, hid themselves between the ceiling and the roof, and
caught, through chinks and crannies, the words artfully drawn
from the victim by another member of the noble gang? The
seventh book of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life of Apollonius</span></span> by Philostratus is a
revelation of the mingled caution and truculence of the
methods of Domitian. Here at least we have left the world
of romance behind and are on solid ground. We feel around
us, as we read, the hundred eyes of an omnipresent tyranny.
We meet in the prison the magistrate of Tarentum who had
been guilty of a dangerous omission in the public prayers, and
an Acarnanian who had been guilty of settling in one of the
Echinades.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> A spy glides into the cells, to listen to the
prisoners’ talk, and is merely regaled by Apollonius with a
description of the wonders he has seen in his wanderings.
When we are admitted to the secret tribunal on the Palatine,
after Domitian has paid his devotion to Athene, we have before
us a cruel, stealthy despot, as timid as he is brutally truculent.
In spite of all scepticism about Philostratus, we are
there at the heart of the Terror.

Compared with this base espionage, even the trade of the
delator becomes almost respectable. Like everything in
Roman social organisation, delation had a long history, too
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg35" id="Pg35" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long to be developed within the space of this work. The
work of impeachment, which might be wholesome and
necessary under the Republic, in exposing the enormities of
provincial government, became the curse of the Empire. The
laws of Augustus for the restoration of social morality gave
the first chance to the professional delator. The jealous,
secretive rule of Tiberius welcomed such sinister support,<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>
and although the dark, tortuous policy of the recluse of
Capreae might punish the excess of zeal in the informers, it
was also ready to reward them for opportune displays of
energy.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> The open and daring tyranny of Caligula and Nero

cruel. He was also a pedant who concealed from himself his
own baseness by a scrupulous devotion to ancient forms even
in religion. The obscene libertine, who chose the Virgin Goddess
as his patroness,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> could easily make the forms of old Roman
justice a cloak for confiscation and massacre. In theory the
voluntary accuser, without a commission from authority, was
a discredited person. And successive emperors punished or
frowned upon the delators of a previous reign.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> Yet the
profession grew in reputation and emolument. It is a
melancholy proof of the degradation of that society that the
delator could be proud of his craft and even envied and
admired. Men of every degree, freedmen, schoolmasters,
petty traders, descendants of houses as old as the Republic,
men from the rank of the shoemaker Vatinius<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> to a Scaurus,
a Cato, or a Regulus, flocked to a trade which might earn a
fabulous fortune and the favour of the prince. There must
have been many a career like that of Palfurius Sura, who had
fought in the arena in the reign of Nero, who had been
disgraced and stripped of his consular rank under Vespasian,
who then turned Stoic and preached the gospel of popular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg36" id="Pg36" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>government, and, in the reign of Domitian, crowned his career
by becoming a delator, and attempting to found a juristic
theory of absolute monarchy.<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>

The system of Roman education, which was profoundly
rhetorical, became a hot-bed of this venal oratory. It nourished
its pupils on the masterpieces of free speech; it inflamed their
imaginations with dreams of rhetorical triumph. When they
went forth into the world of the Empire, they found the only
arena for displaying their powers to be the dull court of the
Centumviri, or the hired lecture hall, where they might dilate
on some frigid or silly theme before a weary audience. It was
a tempting excitement to exert the arts learnt in the school of
Quintilian in a real onslaught, where the life or liberty of the
accused was at stake. And the greatest orators of the past
had never offered to them such a splendid material reward.
One fourth of the estate of the condemned man had been the
old legal fee of the accuser.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> But this limit was left far
behind in the judicial plunder of the early Caesars. Probably
in no other way could a man then so easily make himself a
millionaire. The leading accusers of Thrasea and Soranus in
the reign of Nero received each £42,000 as their reward.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>
These notorious delators, Eprius Marcellus and Vibius Crispus,
accumulated gains reaching, in the end, the enormous amount
of £2,400,000. The famous, or infamous, Regulus, after the
most prodigal expenditure, left a fortune of half a million.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a>
His career is a striking example of the arts by which, in

The inner secret of the imperial Terror will probably
always perplex the historian. The solution of the question
depends, not only on the value which is to be attached to our
authorities, but on the prepossessions and prejudices which are
brought to their interpretation. To one critic Tacitus, although
liable to the faults which spring from rhetorical training and
fervid temperament, seems fairly impartial and trustworthy.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>
Another treats the great historian as essentially a partisan who
derived his materials from the memoirs and traditions of a class
inflamed with reactionary dreams and saturated with a hatred
of monarchy.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> Some regard the tragedy of the early Empire as
the result of a real peril from a senatorial conspiracy which
perpetually surrounded the emperor. Others trace it to the
diseased brains of princes, giddy with the sense of omnipotence,
and often unstrung by vicious excesses, natures at once timorous
and arrogant, anticipating danger by a maniacal cruelty
which ended in creating the peril that they feared. Is it not
possible that there may be truth in both theories? It
may be admitted that there probably was never a powerful
opposition, with a definitely conceived purpose of overthrowing
the imperial system, as it had been organised by Augustus, and
of restoring the republican rule of the Senate. It may be
admitted that, while so many of the first twelve Caesars died a
violent death, the violence was used to rid the world of a
monster, and not to remodel a constitution; it was the
emperor, not the Empire, that was hated. Yet these admissions
need to be qualified by some reservations. The effect
of the rhetorical character of Roman education in moulding the
temper and ideals of the upper classes, down to the very end
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg38" id="Pg38" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the Western Empire, has hardly yet been fully recognised.
It petrified literature by the slavish imitation of unapproachable
models. It also glorified the great ages of freedom and
republican government; it exalted Harmodius and Aristogeiton,
Brutus and Cassius, to a moral height which might
suggest to generous youth the duty or the glory of imitating
them. When a rhetor’s class, in the reign of Caligula or of
Nero, applauded the fall of a historic despot, is it not possible
that some may have applied the lesson to the reigning emperor?
Although it is evident that philosophic debates on the three
forms of government were not unknown, yet probably few ever
seriously thought of a restoration of the republic. None but a
maniac would have entrusted the nerveless, sensual mob of
Rome with the destinies of the world. As a matter of fact,
the mob themselves very much preferred the rule of a lavish
despot, who would cater for their pleasures.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> But the Senate
was still a name of power. In the three or four generations
which had passed since the death of the first Caesar, men had
forgotten the weakness and perfidy which had made senatorial
government impossible. They thought of the Senate as the
stubborn, haughty caste which had foiled the strategy of Hannibal,
which had achieved the conquest of the world. The
old families might have been more than decimated; new men
of doubtful origin might have filled their places.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> But ancient
institutions possess a prestige and power which is often independent
of the men who work them. Men are governed largely
through imagination and mere names. Thus the Senate remained
an imaginative symbol of the glory of Roman power,
down to the last years of the Western Empire. The accomplished
Symmachus cherishes the phantasm of its power under
Honorius. And although a Caligula or Nero might conceive a
feverish hatred of the assembly which they feared,<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> while they
affected to despise it, the better emperors generally made almost
a parade of their respect for the Senate.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> The wisest princes had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg39" id="Pg39" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a feeling that, although they might have at their back the devotion
of the legions, and an immense material force, still it was
wiser to conciliate old Roman feeling by a politic deference to a
body which was surrounded by the aureole of antiquity, which
had such splendid traditions of conquest and administration.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Senate was thus the only possible rival of the Emperor.
The question is, was the Senate ever a dangerous rival?
The true answer seems to be that the Senate was dangerous
in theory, but not in fact. There can be little doubt that, in
the reigns of Caligula and Nero, there were men who dreamed
of a restored senatorial power.<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> It is equally certain that the
Senate was incapable of asserting it. Luxury, self-indulgence,
and conscription had done their work effectually. There were
many pretenders to the principate in the reign of Nero, and
even some in the reign of Vespasian.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> But they had not a
solid and determined Senate at their back. The world, and
even the Senate, were convinced that the Roman Empire
needed the administration of one man. How to get the one
man was the problem. Hereditary succession had placed only
fools or monsters on the throne. There remained the old principle
of adoption. An emperor, feeling that his end was
approaching, might, with all his vast experience of the government
of a world, with all his knowledge of the senatorial class,
with no fear of offence in the presence of death,<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> designate one
worthy of the enormous charge. If such an one came to the
principate, with a generous desire to give the Senate a share of
his burdens and his glory, that was the highest ideal of the
Empire, and that was the ideal which perhaps was approached in
the Antonine age. Yet, outside the circle of practical statesmen,
there remained a class which was long irreconcilable. It has
been recently maintained with great force that the Stoic opposition
was only the opposition of a moral ideal, not the deliberate
propaganda of a political creed.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> This may be true of some of
the philosophers: it is certainly not true of all. Thrasea was a
genial man of the world, whose severest censure expressed itself
in silence and absence from the Senate,<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> who could even, on
occasion, speak with deference of Nero. But his son-in-law,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg40" id="Pg40" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Helvidius Priscus, seemed to exult in flouting and insulting a
great and worthy emperor such as Vespasian.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> And the life
of Apollonius by Philostratus leaves the distinct impression
that philosophy, in the reign of Nero and Domitian, was a
revolutionary force. Apollonius, it is true, is represented by
Philostratus as supporting the cause of monarchy in a debate
in the presence of Vespasian.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> But he boasted of having
been privy to conspiracies against Nero,<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> and he was deeply
involved with Nerva and Orfitus in a plot against Domitian.<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
He was summoned before the secret tribunal to answer
for speeches against the emperor delivered to crowds at
Ephesus.<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> It may be admitted that the invective or scorn
of philosophy was aimed at unworthy princes, rather than at
the foundations of their power. Yet Dion Cassius evidently
regards Helvidius Priscus as a turbulent agitator with dangerous
democratic ideals,<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> and he contrasts his violence with the
studied moderation, combined with dignified reserve, displayed
by Thrasea in the reign of Nero. The tolerant Vespasian,
who bore so long the wanton insults of the philosophers, must
have come at length to think them not only an offence but a
real danger when he banished them. In the first century
there can be little doubt that there were members of the
philosophic class who condemned monarchy, not only as a moral
danger, but as a lamentable aberration from the traditions of
republican freedom. There were probably some, who, if the
chance had offered itself, might even have ventured on a
republican reaction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With a gloomy recognition of the realities of life,
Domitian used to say that conspiracy against an emperor was
never believed till the emperor was killed.<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a> Of the first twelve
Caesars seven died a violent death. Every emperor from
Tiberius to M. Aurelius was the mark of conspiracy. This
was often provoked by the detestable character of the prince.
But it sometimes sprang from other causes than moral disgust.
The mild rule of Vespasian was generally popular; yet even he
had to repel the conspiracy of Aelianus and Marcellus.<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg41" id="Pg41" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>blameless Nerva, the emperor after the Senate’s own heart,
was twice assailed by risings organised by great nobles of
historic name.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> The conspiracy of Nigrinus against Hadrian

M. Aurelius had to endure with sad resignation the open
rebellion of Avidius Cassius.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> The better emperors, strong in
their character and the general justice of their administration,
might afford to treat such opposition with comparative calmness.
But it was different in the case of a Nero or a Domitian. The
conspiracy of Piso and the conspiracy of Saturninus formed, in
each case, a climax and a turning-point. Springing from real
and justified impatience, they were ruthlessly crushed and
followed up with a cruel and suspicious repression which only
increased the danger of the despot. <span class="tei tei-q">“Scelera sceleribus
tuenda”</span> sums up the awful tale, in the words of Tacitus, <span class="tei tei-q">“of
the wrath of God and the madness of men.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were many causes which rendered the tragedy of the
early Empire inevitable. Probably the most potent was the
undefined position of the prince and the dreams of republican
power and freedom which for ages were cherished by the
Senate. Carefully disguised under ancient forms, the principate
of Augustus was really omnipotent, through the possession of the
proconsular imperium in the provinces, and the tribunician prerogative
at home.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> In the last resort there was no legal means
of challenging the man who controlled the legions, nominated
the magistrates, and manipulated a vast treasury at his pleasure.
The fiction of Augustus, that he had restored the Republic to
the hands of the Senate and people, is unlikely to have deceived
his own astute intellect.<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a> The hand which, of its grace
could restore the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">simulacra libertatis</span></span>, might as easily withdraw
them. The Comitia lost even the shadow of constitutional
power in the following reign.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a> Henceforth the people is the
army.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> The holders of the great republican magistracies are
mere creatures of the prince and obedient ministers of his
power. The Senate alone retained some vestiges of its old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg42" id="Pg42" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>power, and still larger pretensions and antiquarian claims. In
theory, during a vacancy in the principate, the Senate was the
ultimate seat of authority, and the new emperor received his
prerogatives by a decree of the Senate. In the work of legislation,
its decisions divided the field with the edicts of the
prince,<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> and it claimed a parallel judicial power. But all this
was really illusory. The working of such a system manifestly
depends on the character and ideas of the man who for the time
wields the material force of the Empire. And <span class="tei tei-q">“the share of
the Senate in the government was in fact determined by the
amount of administrative activity which each emperor saw
fit to allow it to exercise.”</span><a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>

The half-insane Caligula had really a clearer vision of the
emperor’s position than the reactionary dreamers, when he told
his grandmother Antonia, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Memento omnia mihi in omnes licere</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a>
He did not need the lessons of Agrippa and Antiochus to teach
him the secret of tyranny.<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a> Yet institutions can never be
separated from the moral and social forces which lie behind
and around them. The emperor had to depend on agents and
advisers, many of them of social rank and family traditions
equal to his own. He had by his side a Senate with a history
of immemorial antiquity and glory, which cast a spell on the
conservative imagination of a race which recoiled from any
impiety to the past. Above all, he was surrounded by a
populace which took its revenge for the loss of its free Comitia
by a surprising licence of lampoon and epigram and mordant
gossip and clamorous appeal in the circus and theatre.<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> And
even the soldiers, who were the sworn supporters of the prince,
and who often represented better than any other class the tone
of old Roman gravity and manly virtue, could sometimes make
their Imperator feel that there was in reserve a power which
he could not safely defy. Hence it was that, with the changing
character of the prince, the imperial power might pass into a
lawless tyranny, only to be checked by assassination, while again
it might veil its forces under constitutional forms, adopt the
watchwords of the Republic, exalt the Senate to a place beside
the throne, and make even accomplished statesmen fancy for
the time that the days of ancient liberty had returned.

Such a dream, not altogether visionary, floated before Pliny’s
mind when he delivered his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span> in the presence of Trajan.
That speech is at once an act of thanksgiving and a manifesto
of the Senate. The tone of fulsome extravagance is excused
by the joy at escaping from a treacherous tyranny, which drove
virtue into remote retreat, which made friendship impossible,
which poisoned the security of household life by a continual
fear of espionage.<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a> The confidence which Pliny expresses in
the majestic strength, mingled with modesty and self-restraint,
which Trajan brought to the task of the principate, was amply
justified. The overwhelming force of the emperor seemed,
in the new age, to pass into the freely accepted rule of the
great citizen.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> Pliny indeed does not conceal from himself

than Nero’s or Domitian’s, but it is a power no longer wielded
wildly by selfish or cruel self-will; it is a power inspired by
benevolence, voluntarily submitting itself to the restraints of
law and ancient sentiment.<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a> Founded on service and virtue,
it can fearlessly claim the loving support of the citizens,
while it recalls the freedom of the old Republic. A prince who
is hedged by the devotion of his people may dispense with
the horde of spies and informers, who have driven virtue into
banishment and made a crowd of sneaks and cowards. Free
speech has been restored. The Senate, which has so long been
expected to applaud with grovelling flattery the most trivial
or the most flagitious acts of the emperor, is summoned to a
share in the serious work of government.<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a> A community of

by a scrupulous observance of old republican forms. The
commander of conquering legions, the Caesar, Augustus,
Pontifex Maximus, has actually condescended to take the oath
of office, standing before the consul seated in his chair!<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> Here
we seem to have the key to the senatorial position. They
were ready to recognise the overwhelming power of the prince,
if he, for his part, would only respect in form, if not in substance,
the ancient dignity of the Senate. Tolerance, affability,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg44" id="Pg44" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>politic deference to a great name, seemed to Pliny and his
kind a restoration of the ancient freedom, almost a revival of
the old Republic. Fortunately for the world a succession of
wise princes perceived that, by deference to the pride of the
Senate, they could secure the peace of their administration,
without diminishing its effective power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, even from Pliny’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span>, we can see that the
recognition of the prerogatives, or rather of the dignity, of
the Senate, the coexistence of old republican forms side by
side with imperial power, depended entirely on the grace and
tolerance of the master of the legions. Nothing could be more
curious than Pliny’s assertion of the senatorial claims, combined
with the most effusive gratitude to Trajan for conceding them.
The emperor is only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">primus inter pares</span></span>, and yet Pliny, by
the whole tone of his speech, admits that he is the master who
may equally indulge the constitutional claims or superstitions
of his subjects or trample on them. In the first century a
power, the extent of which depended only on the will of the
prince, and yet seemed limited by shadowy claims of ancient
tradition, was liable to be distrustful of itself and to be
challenged by pretenders. In actual fact, the prince was so
powerful that he might easily pass into a despot; in theory
he was only the first of Roman nobles, who might easily have
rivals among his own class. Pliny congratulates Trajan on
having, by his mildness and justice, escaped the terror of pretenders
which haunted the earlier emperors, and was often
justified and cruelly avenged.<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> In spite of the lavish splendour
of Nero or Caligula, the imperial household, till Hadrian’s
reorganisation, was still modelled on the lines of other great
aristocratic houses. Nero’s suspicions were more than once
excited by the scale of establishments like that of the Silani,
by wealth and display like Seneca’s, by the lustre of great
historic traditions in a gens like the Calpurnian.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> The loyalty

governors, in command of great armies, and administering
realms such as Gaul or Spain or Syria, was not an altogether
imaginary danger. If Domitian seemed distrustful of Agricola
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg45" id="Pg45" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in Britain, we must remember that he had in his youth seen
Galba and Vindex marching on Rome, and his father concentrating
the forces of the East for the overthrow of Vitellius
in the great struggle on the Po.

The emperor’s fears and suspicions were immensely
aggravated by the adepts in the dark arts of the East. The
astrologers were a great and baneful power in the early Empire.
They inspired illicit ambitions, or they stimulated them, and
they often suggested to a timorous prince the danger of
conspiracy. These venal impostors, in the words of Tacitus,
were always being banished, but they always returned. For
the men who drove them into temporary exile had the
firmest faith in their skill. The prince would have liked to
keep a monopoly of it, while he withdrew from his nobles the
temptation which might be offered to their ambition by the
mercenary adept.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> Dion Cassius and Suetonius, who were themselves

dark tales about them.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> Claudius drove Scribonianus into
exile for consulting an astrologer about the term of his reign.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>
On the appearance of a flaming comet, Nero was warned by
his diviner, Bilbilus, that a portent, which always boded ill
to kings, might be expiated by the blood of their nobles.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>
Otho’s astrologer, Seleucus, who had promised that he should
survive Nero,<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> stimulated his ambition to be the successor of
Galba. Vitellius, as superstitious as Nero or Otho, cruelly
persecuted the soothsayers and ordered their expulsion from
Italy.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> He was defied by a mocking edict of the tribe,

Vespasian once more banished the diviners from Rome, but,
obedient to the superstition which cradled the power of his
dynasty, he retained the most skilful for his own guidance.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> The
terror of Domitian’s last days was heightened by a horoscope,
which long before had foretold the time and manner of his
end.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> Holding such a faith as this, it is little wonder that
the emperors should dread its effect on rivals who were equally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg46" id="Pg46" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>credulous, or that superstition, working on ambitious hopes,
should have been the nurse of treason. Thus the emperor’s
uncertain position made him ready to suspect and anticipate a
treachery which may often have had no existence. The objects
of his fears in their turn were driven into conspiracy, sometimes
in self-defence, sometimes from the wish to seize a prize
which seemed not beyond their grasp. Gossip, lampoon, and
epigram redoubled suspicion, while they retaliated offences.
And cruel repression either increased the danger of revolt in
the more daring, or the degradation of the more timorous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the eyes of Tacitus, the most terrible result of the tyranny
of the bad emperors was the fawning servility of a once proud
order, and their craven treachery in the hour of danger. He
has painted it with all the concentrated power of loathing and
pity. It is this almost personal degradation which inspires the
ruthless, yet haughtily restrained, force with which he blasts
for ever the memory of the Julio-Claudian despotism. It was
in this spirit that he penned the opening chapters of his
chronicle of the physical and moral horrors of the year in
which that tyranny closed. The voice of history has been
silenced or perverted, partly by the ignorance of public affairs,
partly by the eagerness of adulation, or the bitterness of
hatred. It was an age darkened by external disasters, save
on the eastern frontier, by seditions and civil war, and the
bloody death of four princes. The forces of nature seemed to
unite with the rage of men to deepen the universal tragedy.
Italy was overwhelmed with calamities which had been
unknown for many ages; Campania’s fairest cities were
swallowed up; Rome itself had been wasted by fire; the
ancient Capitol was given to the flames by the hands of
citizens. Polluted altars, adultery in high places, the islands
of the sea crowded with exiles, rank and wealth and virtue
made the mark for a cruel jealousy, all this forms an awful
picture.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> But even more repulsive is the spectacle of treachery
rewarded with the highest place, slaves and clients betraying
their master for gain, and men without an enemy ruined by
their friends. When the spotless Octavia, overwhelmed by
the foulest calumnies, had been tortured to death, to satisfy
the jealousy of an adulteress, offerings were voted to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg47" id="Pg47" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>temples.<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> And Tacitus grimly requests his readers to presume
that, as often as a banishment or execution was ordered by
Nero, so often were thanksgivings offered to the gods. The
horrors of Nero’s remorse for the murder of Agrippina were
soothed by the flatteries and congratulations of his staff, and
the grateful sacrifices which were offered for his deliverance by
the Campanian towns.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> Still, the notes of a funereal trumpet
and ghostly wailings from his mother’s grave were ever in
his ears,<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a> and he long doubted the reception which he might
meet with on his return to the capital. He need not have
had any anxiety. Senate and people vied with one another
in self-abasement. He was welcomed by all ranks and ages
with fawning enthusiasm as he passed along in triumphal
progress to return thanks on the Capitol for the success of an
unnatural crime.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pisonian conspiracy against Nero was undoubtedly
an important and serious event. Some of the greatest names
of the Roman aristocracy were involved in it, and the man
whom it would have placed on the throne, if not altogether
untainted by the excesses of his time, had some imposing
qualities which might make him seem a worthy competitor for
the principate.<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a> But, to Tacitus, the conspiracy seems to be
chiefly interesting as a damning proof of the degradation of
the aristocracy under the reign of terror. Epicharis, the poor
freedwoman of light character, who bore the accumulating
torture of scourge and rack and fire, and the dislocation of
every limb, is brought into pathetic contrast with the high-born
senators and knights, who, without any compulsion of
torture, betrayed their relatives and friends.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> Scaevinus, a man
of the highest rank, knowing himself betrayed by his freedman
and a Roman knight, revealed the whole plot.<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> The poet
Lucan tried in vain to purchase safety by involving his
own mother. But Nero was inexorable, and the poet died
worthily, reciting some verses from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharsalia</span></span>, which
describe a similar end.<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a> The scenes which followed the
massacre are an awful revelation of cowardly sycophancy.
While the streets were thronged with the funerals of the victims,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg48" id="Pg48" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the altars on the Capitol were smoking with sacrifices of gratitude.
One craven after another, when he heard of the murder
of a brother or a dear friend, would deck his house with
laurels, and, falling at the emperor’s feet, cover his hand
with kisses.<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> The Senate prostrated themselves before Nero
when, stung by the popular indignation, he appeared to
justify his deed. The august body voted him thanksgivings
and honours.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a> The consul elect, one of the Anician house,
proposed that a temple should be built with all speed to the
divine Nero! Tacitus relieves this ghastly spectacle of effeminate
cowardice by a scene which is probably intended, by way
of contrast, to save the tradition of Roman dignity. Vestinus,
the consul of that fatal year, had been a boon companion of
the emperor, and had shown contempt for his cowardice in
dangerous banter. Nero was eager to find him implicated
in the plot, but no evidence of his guilt could be obtained.
All legal forms at length were flung aside, and a cohort was
ordered to surround his house. Vestinus was at dinner in his
palace which towered over the Forum, surrounded by guests,
with a train of handsome slaves in waiting, when he received
the mandate. He rose at once from table, and shut himself in
his chamber with his physician, lancet in hand, by his side.
His veins were opened, and, without a word of self-pity,
Vestinus allowed his life to ebb away in the bath.<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vestinus, after all, only asserted, in the fashion of the time,
his right to choose the manner of a death which could not be
evaded. But Tacitus, here and there, gives glimpses of self-sacrifice,
courageous loyalty and humanity, which save his
picture of society from utter gloom. The love and devotion
of women shine out more brightly than ever against the
background of baseness. Tender women follow their husbands
or brothers into exile, or are found ready to share their death.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a>
Even the slave girls of Octavia brave torture and death in
their hardy defence of her fair fame.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> There is no more
pathetic story of female heroism than that of Politta, the
daughter of L. Vetus. He had been colleague of the emperor
in the consulship, but he had the misfortune to be father-in-law
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg49" id="Pg49" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Rubellius Plautus, whose lofty descent and popularity drew
down the sentence of death, even in distant exile.<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> Politta had
clasped the bleeding neck of Plautus in her arms, and nursed
her sorrow in an austere widowhood.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> She now besieged the
doors of Nero with prayers, and even menaces, for her father’s
acquittal. Vetus himself was of the nobler sort of Roman men,
who even then were not extinct. When he was advised, in order
to save the remnant of his property for his grandchildren, to
make the emperor chief heir, he spurned the servile proposal,
divided his ready money among his slaves, and prepared for the
end.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> When all hope was abandoned, father, grandmother, and
daughter opened their veins and died together in the bath.
Plautius Lateranus met his end with the same stern dignity.
Forbidden even to give a last embrace to his children, and
dragged to the scene of servile executions, he died in silence by
the hand of a man who was an undiscovered partner in the plot.<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>
Even the mob of Rome, for whose fickle baseness Tacitus has a
profound scorn, now and then reveal a wholesome moral feeling.
When Octavia, on a trumped-up charge of adultery, was
divorced and banished by Nero, the clamour of the populace
forced him to recall her for a time, and the mob went so far
in their virtuous enthusiasm as to overthrow the statues of
the adulteress Poppaea, and crown the images of Octavia with
flowers.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> Perhaps even more striking is the humane feeling
displayed towards the slaves of the urban prefect, Pedanius
Secundus. He had been murdered by a slave, and the ancient
law required, in such a case, the execution of the whole household.
The proposal to carry out the cruel custom drove the
populace almost to revolt. And it is a relief to find that a
strong minority of the Senate were on the side of humanity.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a>
But the army, above all other classes, still bred a rough, honest
virtue. It was left, amid the general effeminate cowardice,
for a tribune of a pretorian cohort to tell Nero to his face that
he loathed him as a murderer and an incendiary.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> Again and
again, in that terrible year, when great nobles were flattering
the Emperor, whom in a few days or hours they meant to
desert, the common soldiers remained true to the death of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg50" id="Pg50" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their unworthy chiefs. When Otho redeemed a tainted life
by a not ignoble end, the pretorians kissed his wounds, bore
him with tears to burial, and many killed themselves over his
corpse.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> In the storming of the pretorian camp by the troops
of Vespasian, the soldiers of Vitellius, outnumbered and doomed
to certain defeat, fell to a man with all their wounds in front.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these faithful, though often bloodthirsty, warriors the
senators and knights of those days offered a contemptible
contrast. Often the inheritors of great names and great
traditions, the mass of them knew nothing of arms or the
military virtue of their ancestors.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> Sunk in sloth and

to Otho, from Otho to Vitellius, from Vitellius to Vespasian,
the great nobles had one guiding principle, the determination
to be on the winning side. It was indeed a puzzling and
anxious time for a calculating selfishness, when a reign might
not last for a month, and when the adulation of Otho or
Vitellius in the Senate-house was disturbed by the sound of
the legions advancing from East and West. But the
supple cowards of the Senate proved equal to the strain.
They had the skill to flatter their momentary master without
any compromising word against his probable successor. They
soothed the anxieties of Vitellius with unstinted adulation,
yet carefully refrained from anything reflecting on the
Flavianist leaders.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> Within a few months, full of joy and

The terror of Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero had done its work
effectually. And its worst result was the hopeless self-abandonment
and sluggish cowardice of a class, whose chief
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d’être</span></span> in every age is to maintain a tradition of gallant
dignity. It is true that many of the scions of great houses
were mere mendicants, ruined by confiscation or prodigality, and
compelled to live on the pension by which the emperor kept
them in shameful dependence,<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> or on the meaner dole of some

voluptuous excesses of an age which had carried the ingenuity
of sensual allurement to its utmost limits. The hopelessness
of any struggle with a power so vast as that of the emperor,
so ruthless and wildly capricious as that of the Claudian
Caesars, reduced many to despairing apathy.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> And while,
from a safe historic distance, we pour our contempt on the
cringing Senate of the first century, it might be well to remind
ourselves of their perils and their tortures. There was many
a senatorial house, like that of the Pisos, whose leading
members were never allowed to reach middle age.<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> Much

suborned testimony; it might appear in a quiet order for suicide;

in some retreat in Spain or Asia. The haunting fear of death
had an unnerving effect. But not less degrading were the
outrages to Roman, or ordinary human dignity to which the
noble order had to submit for more than a generation. They
had seen their wives defiled or compelled to expose themselves
as harlots in a foul spectacle, to gratify the diseased prurience
of the emperor.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> They had been forced to fight in the arena

the seductive charm which he undoubtedly possessed, were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg52" id="Pg52" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>probably as enfeebling and demoralising as the Terror. He
formed a school, which laughed at all virtue and made self-indulgence
a fine art. Men who had shared in these obscene
revels were the leaders in the awful scenes of perfidy, lust,
and cruelty which appropriately followed the death of their
patron.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> Some of them, Petronius, Otho, Vitellius, closed

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In spite of the manly virtue and public spirit of Vespasian,
the Roman world had to endure a fierce ordeal before it
entered on the peace of the Antonine age. Even Vespasian’s
reign was troubled by conspiracy.<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> His obscure origin moved
the contempt of the great senatorial houses who still survived.
His republican moderation gave the philosophic doctrinaires a
chance of airing their impossible dream of restoring a municipal
Republic to govern a world. His conscientious frugality,
which was absolutely needed to retrieve the bankruptcy of the
Neronian régime, was despised and execrated both by the nobles
and the mob. Another lesson was needed both by the Senate
and the philosophers. Society had yet to be purged as by fire,
and the purging came with the accession of Domitian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inner secret of that sombre reign will probably remain
for ever a mystery. There is the same question about
Domitian as there is about Tiberius. Was he bad from the
beginning, or was he gradually corrupted by the consciousness
of immense power,<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> and the fear of the great order who
might challenge it? Our authorities do not furnish a satisfying
answer. We know Domitian only from the narrative of
men steeped in senatorial traditions and prejudices,<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> and,
some of them, intoxicated by the vision of a reconciliation
of the principate with the republican ideals. The dream
was a noble one, and it was about to be partially realised
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg53" id="Pg53" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for three generations, under a succession of good emperors.
But the men inspired with such an ideal were not likely to be
impartial judges of an emperor like Domitian. And even
from their narrative of his reign, we can see that he was not,
at least in the early years of his reign,<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> the utter monster he
has been painted. Even severe judges in modern days admit
that he was an able and strenuous man, with a clear, cold,
cynical intellect,<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> which recognised some of the great problems
of the time, and strove to solve them. He was indefatigable in
judicial work.<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> In spite of the sneers at his mock triumphs,<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a>
his military and provincial administration was probably
guided by a sound conception of the resources and the
dangers of the Empire. His recall of Agricola, after a seven
years’ command in Britain, was attributed to jealousy and fear.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a>
It is more probable that it was dictated by a wish to stop a
campaign which was diverting large sums to the conquest of
barren mountains. Domitian was an orator and verse writer
of some merit, and he gave his patronage, although not in a
very liberal way, to men like Quintilian, Statius, and Martial.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a>
Like Nero, he felt the force of the new Hellenist movement,
and, under forms sanctioned by Roman antiquarians, he established
a quinquennial festival in which literary genius was
pompously rewarded.<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href="#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> He had the public libraries, which had
been devastated by fires in the previous reigns, liberally restocked
with fresh stores of MSS. from Alexandria.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> He gave
close attention, whatever we may think of his science, to the
economic problems of the Empire. And his discouragement
of the vine, in favour of a greater acreage of corn, would find
sympathy in our own time, as it was applauded by Apollonius
of Tyana.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> The man who decimated the Roman aristocracy
towards the end of his reign, advanced to high positions some
of those who were destined to be his bitterest defamers. Pliny
and Tacitus and Trajan’s father rose to high office in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg54" id="Pg54" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>earlier part of Domitian’s reign.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> He designated to the
consulship such men as Nerva, Trajan, Verginius Rufus,
Agricola, and the grandfather of Antoninus Pius.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> This strange
character was also a moral reformer of the antiquarian type.
He punished erring Vestals, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">more majorum</span></span>. He revived the
Scantinian law against those enormities of the East, of which
Statius shows that the emperor was not guiltless himself.<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> Yet
a voluptuary, with a calm outlook on his time, may have a wish
to restrain vices with which he is himself tainted. A statesman
may be a puritan reformer, both in religion and morals, without
being personally severe and devout. Domitian may have
had a genuine, if a pedantic, desire to restore the old Roman
tone in morals and religion. He was, after all, sprung from a
sober Sabine stock,<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> although he may have sadly degenerated
from it in his own conduct. And his attempt to reform Roman
society may perhaps have been as sincere as that of Augustus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there can be little doubt that Domitian, although he
was astute and able, was also a bad man, with the peculiar
traits which always make a man unpopular. He was disloyal
as a son and as a brother. He was morose, and he cultivated
a suspicious solitude,<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> around which evil rumour is sure to
gather. The rumour in his case may have been well-founded,
although we are not bound to believe all the tales of prurient
gossip which Suetonius has handed down. It is the penalty
of high place that peccadilloes are magnified into sins, and
sins are multiplied and exaggerated. It was a recognised and
effective mode of flattering a new emperor to blacken the
character of his predecessors; Domitian himself allowed his
court poets to vilify Caligula and Nero.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> And Pliny in his
fulsome adulation of Trajan, finds his most effective resource in
a perpetual contrast with Domitian. Tacitus could never forgive
the recall and humiliation of his father-in-law. The Senate
as a whole bore an implacable hatred to the man who carried
to its furthest point the assertion of imperial prerogative.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg55" id="Pg55" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Still the authorities are so unanimous that we are bound to
believe that Domitian, with some strength and ability, had
many execrable qualities. He shows the contradictions of a
nature in which the force of a sturdy rural ancestry has not
been altogether sapped by the temptations of luxury and
power. He had a passionate desire to rival the military glory
of his father and brother, yet he was too cautious and self-indulgent
to attain it. He had some taste for literature, but
he kept literature in leading-strings, and put one man to death
for his delight in certain speeches in Livy, and another for a
too warm eulogy of Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus.<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> He threw
his whole strength into a moral and religious reaction, while
he was the bitterest enemy of the republican pretensions and
dreams of the Senate. Great historical critics have called him
a hypocrite.<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> It may be doubted whether any single phrase
or formula could express the truth about such a twisted and
perverse <a name="corr55" id="corr55" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">character.</span> Probably his dominant passion was vanity
and love of grandiose display. He assumed the consulship
seventeen times, a number quite unexampled.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> His pompous
triumphs for unreal victories were a subject of common jest.
He filled the Capitol with images of himself, and a colossal
statue towered for a time over the temple roofs.<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a> The son
and brother of emperors, already exalted to divine honours, he
went farther than any of his predecessors in claiming divinity
for himself, and he allowed his ministers and court poets to
address him as <span class="tei tei-q">“our Lord God.”</span><a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> His lavish splendour in
architecture was to some extent justified by the ravages of fire
in previous reigns. But the £2,400,000 expended on the
gilding of a temple on the Capitol,<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a> was only one item in an
extravagance which drained the treasury. Its radiance, which
dazzled the eyes of Rutilius in the reign of Honorius,<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> was
paid for in blood and tears. The emperor, who was the ruthless
enemy of the nobles, like all his kind, was profusely
indulgent to the army and the mob. The legions had their pay
increased by a fourth. The populace of Rome were pampered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg56" id="Pg56" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with costly and vulgar spectacles,<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> as they were to the end of
the Western Empire. Domitian’s indulgence of that fierce and
obscene proletariat was only a little more criminal than that
of other emperors, because it ended in a bankruptcy which was
followed by robbery and massacre. While the rich and noble
were assailed on any trivial accusation, in order to fill an
empty treasury, the beasts of Numidia were tearing their
victims, gladiators were prostituting a noble courage in dealing
inglorious wounds in the arena, and fleets of armed galleys
charged and crashed in mimic, yet often deadly, battle in the
flooded Flavian amphitheatre.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To repair this waste the only resource was plunder. But
Domitian was a pettifogger as well as a plunderer; he would
fleece or assassinate his victims under forms of law. The
law of majesty, and the many laws for restoring old Roman
morality, needed only a little ingenuity and effrontery to
furnish lucrative grounds for impeachment.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> The tribe of
delators were ready to his hand. He had punished them for
serving Nero; they were now to reap a richer harvest under
Domitian. Every fortune which rose above mediocrity, every
villa with rich pastures and woodlands in the Apennines, or
on the northern lakes, was marked for plunder.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> Domitian was

fortunes of his nobles. A casual word, a thoughtless gesture,
might be construed into an act of treason; and the slave
households furnished an army of spies. Nay, even kindred
and near friends were drawn into this vast conspiracy against
domestic peace and security. It may be admitted that
Domitian had to face a real peril. The rebellion of Antonius
Saturninus was an attempt which no prince could treat lightly,
and the destruction of the correspondence in which so many
men of rank were involved, may well have heightened
Domitian’s alarm.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> He struck out blindly and savagely.
He compelled the Senate to bear a part in the massacre, and
Tacitus has confessed, with pathetic humiliation, his silent share
in the murder of the upright and innocent.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> Yet the imperial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg57" id="Pg57" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>inquisitor was himself racked with terror in his last hours. He
walked in a corridor where the walls were lined with mirrors,<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>
so that no unseen hand might strike him from behind. On
his last morning he started in terror from his bed and called
for the diviner whom he had summoned from Germany.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a> But,
amid all his terror, Domitian had a deep natural love of
cruelty. He was never more dangerous than when he chose
to be agreeable;<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> he loved to play with his victims. What
a grim delight in exquisite torture, what a cynical contempt
for the Roman nobles, are revealed in the tale of his funereal
banquet!<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> The select company were ushered into a chamber
draped from floor to ceiling in black. At the head of each
couch stood a pillar like a tombstone, with the guest’s name
engraved upon it, while overhead swung a cresset such as men
hang in vaults of the dead. A troop of naked boys, black as
all around, danced an awful measure, and then set on the
dismal meal which was offered, by old Roman use, to the spirits
of the departed. The guests were palsied with terror, expecting
every moment to be their last. And the death-like
silence was only broken by the voice of the Emperor as he
told a gruesome tale of bloody deaths. In such cynicism of
lawless power, in such meek degradation of a once proud
order, did the tyranny of the first century reach its close.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Juvenal and Tacitus, although they moved in different circles
and probably never met, have much in common. Both were
released from an ignominious silence by the death of Domitian.
Both were then at the age which combines the ripeness
of experience and reflection with a fire and energy still
unflagging.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> They were, from different causes, both filled with
hatred and disgust for the vices of their time, and their experience
had engendered in both a pessimism which darkened
their faith. Tacitus belonged to the senatorial order who had
held high office, and had seen its ranks decimated and its
dignity outraged under the tyranny. Juvenal sprang from the
lower middle class, which hated alike the degenerate noble and
the insolent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span> far more than it hated even a Domitian.
Yet both Juvenal and Tacitus are united in a passionate
admiration for the old Roman character. Their standards and
ideals are drawn from the half-mythical ages of the simple
warriors and farmer-statesmen of the old Republic. And their
estimate of their time needs to be scrutinised in the light both
of their hatreds and of their ideals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The life of Juvenal is wrapt in obscurity, although nine
lives of him are extant.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> Scholars are still at variance as to
the date of his birth, the date of many of his satires, and
especially as to the time and circumstances of his banishment,
about which there is so uniform a tradition. But, for our
purpose, some facts are clear enough. Juvenal was the son of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg59" id="Pg59" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a well-to-do freedman of Aquinum, and rose to the highest
magisterial office in his native town at some time of his career.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>
He carefully hides his personal history from us; but we might
gather from his Satires that he belonged to the lower middle
class,<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> that he was in temper and tone an old plebeian of the
times of the Republic, although vividly touched by the ideas
of a new morality which had been afloat for more than two
generations. But, like Tacitus, he has little sympathy with the
great philosophic movement which was working a silent revolution.
He had the rhetorical training of the time, with all
its advantages and its defects. And he is more a rhetorician
than a poet. We can well believe the report that his early
literary enthusiasm found vent in declamation on those
mythical or frivolous themes which exercised the youth in
the Roman schools for many centuries. Although he was
hardly a poor man<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> in the sense in which Martial, his
friend, was poor, yet he had stooped to bear the ignominy and
hardships of client dependence. He had hurried in rain and
storm in the early morning to receptions at great houses on
the Esquiline, through the squalor and noises and congested
traffic of the Suburra.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> He had doubtless often been a guest
at those <span class="tei tei-q">“unequal dinners,”</span> where the host, who was himself
regaled with far-fetched dainties and old crusted Alban or
Setine wine, insulted his poorer friends by offering them the
cheapest vintage and the meanest fare.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> He had been compelled,
as a matter of social duty, to sit through the recitation
of those ambitious and empty Theseids and Thebaids, with which
the rich amateur in literature in those days afflicted his long-suffering
friends.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> He may have been often elbowed aside by
some supple, clever Greek, with versatile accomplishments and
infinite audacity. He may have been patronised or insulted by
a millionaire <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span>, like the Trimalchio of Petronius, tainted
with the memories of a shameful servitude. He saw new
vulgar wealth everywhere triumphant, while the stiff, yet, in
many ways, wholesome conventionality of old Roman life was
defied and trampled upon by an aggressive vulgarity. In such
a world there was little room for the man whose wealth is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg60" id="Pg60" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in his genius, and who clings to the traditions of ages which
believed that men had a soul as well as a body. A man like
Juvenal, living in such a society, almost necessarily becomes
embittered. Like Johnson, in his Grub Street days, he will
have his hours when bitterness passes into self-abandonment,
and he will sound the depths of that world of corruption which
in his better moods he loathes. Some of the associates of
Juvenal were of very doubtful position, and more than doubtful
morals;<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a> and the warmth of some of his realistic painting of
dark sides of Roman life arouses the suspicion that he may
have at times forgotten his moral ideal. He certainly knows
the shameful secrets of Roman life almost as well as his friend
Martial does. But his knowledge, however gained, was turned
to a very different purpose from that which inspired Martial’s
brilliant prurience.<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Satires of Juvenal were probably not given to the
world till after the death of Domitian.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> The date of the earliest
is about 100 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, that of the latest probably 127. Juvenal
cautiously disguises his attacks on his own time. He whets his
sword against the sinners whose ashes have long reposed beside
the Flaminian and the Latin ways.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> Very few of his contemporaries
appear in his pages,<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> and the scenery is often that
of the reigns of Tiberius, Claudius, or Nero. But his deepest
and most vivid impressions must have come to Juvenal in that
period which has been photographed with such minute exactness
by Martial. And there is a striking correspondence between
the two writers, not only in many of the characters whom they
introduce, but in their pictures of the whole state of morals and
letters.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> They both detested that frigid epic which laboriously
ploughed the sands of conventional legend, and they turned
with weariness from the old-world tales of Thebes or Argos to
the real tragedy or comedy of Roman life around them.
Although they were friends and companions, it is needless to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg61" id="Pg61" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>assume any close partnership in their studies. Starting with
the same literary impulse, they deal to a large extent with the
same vices and follies, some of them peculiar to their own age,
others common to all ages of Rome, or even of the world of
civilisation. A long list might easily be compiled of their
common stock of subjects, and their common antipathies. In
both writers we meet the same grumbling of the needy client
against insolent or niggardly patrons, the complaints of the
struggling man of letters about the extravagant rewards of low
vulgar impostors. Both are bored to death, like the patient
Pliny, by the readings of wealthy scribblers, or by tiresome
pleadings in the courts, measured by many a turn of the
clepsydra. They feel an equal disgust for the noise and
squalor of the narrow streets, an equal love for the peace and
freshness and rough plenty of the country farm. In both may
be seen the scions of great houses reduced to mendicancy,
ambitious poverty betaking itself to every mean or disreputable
device, the legacy-hunter courting the childless rich with
flattery or vicious compliance. You will often encounter the
sham philosopher, as you meet him sixty years afterwards in
the pages of Lucian, with his loud talk of virtue and illustrious
names, while his cloak covers all the vices of dog and ape. Both
deal rather ungently with the character of women,—their
intrigues with actors, gladiators, and slaves, their frequent
divorces and rapid succession of husbands, their general
abandonment of antique matronly reserve. Both have, in fact,
with different motives, uncovered the secret shame of the
ancient world; and, more even than by that shame, was their
indignation moved by the great social revolution which was
confusing all ranks, and raising old slaves, cobblers, and
auctioneers to the benches of the knights.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet with this resemblance in the subjects of their choice,
there is the widest difference between the two writers in their
motive and mode of treatment. Martial, of course, is not a
moralist at all; the mere suggestion excites a smile. He is a
keen and joyous observer of the faults and follies, the lights
and shades, of a highly complex and artificial society which is
<span class="tei tei-q">“getting over-ripe.”</span> In the power of mere objective description
and minute portraiture of social life, Martial is almost
unique. Through his verses, we know the society of Domitian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg62" id="Pg62" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as we know hardly any other period of ancient society. But
this very vividness and truthfulness is chiefly due to the fact
that Martial was almost without a conscience. He was indeed
personally, perhaps, not so bad as he is often painted.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> He
knows and can appreciate a good woman;<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> he can love, with
the simplest, unsophisticated love, an innocent slave-child, the
poor little Erotion,<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a> whom he has immortalised. He can
honour a simple manly character, free from guile and pretence.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>
He has a genuine, exuberant love of the fresh joys of
country life, sharpened, no doubt, by the experience of the
client’s sordid slavery, amid the mingled poverty and lavish
splendour of the capital.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> Where could one find a fresher,
prettier idyll than his picture of the farm of Faustinus, with its
packed granaries, and its cellars fragrant with the juice of many
an old autumn vintage, the peacock spreading his jewelled
plumage, and the ring-dove cooing overhead from the towers?
The elegant slaves of the great house in the city are having
a holiday, and busy, under the bailiff’s care, with rural toils,
or fishing in the stream. The tall daughters of the neighbouring
cottages bring in their well-stocked baskets to the
villa, and all gather joyously at evening to a plenteous meal.<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>
Martial has, moreover, one great virtue, which is a powerful antidote
for many moral faults, the love of the far-off home of his
childhood, the rugged Bilbilis, with its iron foundries near
the sources of the Tagus, to which he retreated from the crush
and din of plebeian life at Rome, and where he rests.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> But
when charity or justice has done its best for Martial,
and no scholar will repudiate the debt, it still remains true
that he represents, perhaps better than any other, that pagan
world, naked and unabashed, and feels no breath of inspiration
from the great spiritual movement which, in paganism itself,
was setting towards an ideal of purity and self-conquest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Juvenal, at least in his later work, reveals a moral
standard and motive apparently unknown to Martial.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> It may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg63" id="Pg63" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be admitted, indeed, that Juvenal did not always write under
the same high impulse. He had the rhetorician’s love of
fine, telling phrases, and startling effects. He had a rare gift
of realistic painting, and he exults in using it. He has also
burning within him an old plebeian pride which looked down
at once on the degenerate son of an ancient house, and on
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nouveaux riches</span></span>, whose rise seemed to him the triumph of
vulgar opulence without the restraint of traditions or ideals.
Conscious of great talents, with a character almost fierce in
its energy, he felt a burning hatred of a society which seemed
to value only material success, or those supple and doubtful
arts which could invent some fresh stimulus for exhausted
appetite. In Juvenal a great silent, sunken class, whom
we hardly know otherwise than from the inscriptions on their
tombs,<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> finds for once a powerful voice and a terrible avenger.
But, along with this note of personal or class feeling, there is
in Juvenal a higher moral intuition, a vision of a higher life,
which had floated before some Roman minds long before his
time,<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a> and which was destined to broaden into an accepted ideal.
Juvenal, indeed, was no philosopher, and he had, like Tacitus,
all the old Roman distrust of the theories of the schools.<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
He had probably little respect for such teaching as Seneca’s.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a>
Yet in important points he and Seneca belong to the same order
of the elect. Although, perhaps, a less spotless character than
Tacitus, he is far more advanced and modern in his breadth
of sympathy and moral feeling. He feels acutely for the
conquered provinces which have been fleeced and despoiled
of their wealth and artistic treasures, and which are still
exposed to the peculation and cruelty of governors and their
train.<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a> He denounces, like Seneca, the contempt and cruelty often
shown to slaves. The man whose ideal seems often to be drawn
from the hard, stern warriors who crushed the Samnites and
baffled the genius of Hannibal, in his old age has come to
glorify pity and tenderness for suffering as the best gift of
God, the gift that separates him most widely from the brute
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg64" id="Pg64" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>creation.<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> He preaches sympathy and mutual help, in an
age torn by selfish individualist passions. He denounces the
lust for revenge almost in the tones of a Christian preacher.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a>
What heathen moralist has painted more vividly the horrors
of the guilty conscience, that unseen inquisitor, with sterner
more searching eyes than Rhadamanthus? Who has taught
with greater power that the root of sin is in the evil thought?<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a>
Juvenal realises, like Tacitus and Quintilian, the curse of a
tainted ancestry, and the incalculable importance of pure
example in the education of youth.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> He, who knew so well
the awful secrets of Roman households, sets an immense value
on the treasure of an untainted boyhood, like that of the ploughman’s
son, who waits at Juvenal’s simple meal <span class="tei tei-q">“and sighs for
his mother, and the little cottage, and his playmates the kids.”</span><a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a>
Observation of character had also taught him the fatal law that
the downward path in conduct, once entered on, is seldom retraced.
And this moral insight seems to come to Juvenal not from
any consciously held philosophic doctrine, nor from a settled
religious faith. His faith, like that of many of his time, was
probably of the vaguest. He scorns and detests the Eastern
worships which were pouring in like a flood, and carrying
away even loose women of the world.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> He pillories the
venal star-reader from the East and the Jewish hag who
interprets dreams. But he has also scant respect for classic
mythologies, and regrets the simple, long-gone age, before
heaven became crowded with divinities, before Saturn had
exchanged the diadem for the sickle, when Juno was still a
little maid,<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a> when the terrors of Tartarus, the wheel, the
vulture, and the lash of the Furies had not taken the place of
a simple natural conscience.<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Juvenal’s moral tone then appears to unite the spirit of two
different ages. In some of his later Satires you catch the accent
of the age which was just opening when Juvenal began to write,
its growing sense of the equality and brotherhood of man, its
cosmopolitan morality, its ideals of spiritual culture. But
there are other elements in Juvenal, derived from old Roman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg65" id="Pg65" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prejudice and conventionality, or the result of personal temperament
and experience, which are quite as prominent. Juvenal
is an utter pessimist about his time, more extreme even than
Tacitus. His age, if we believe him, has attained the climax
of corruption, and posterity will never improve upon its
finished depravity.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> His long practice as a declaimer had
given him a habit of exaggeration, and of aiming rather at
rhetorical brilliancy than truth. Whole passages in his
poems read like declamatory exercises turned into verse.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a>
A mere hanger-on of great society, one of the obscure crowd
who flocked to the rich man’s levée, and knowing the life of
the aristocracy only by remote observation or the voice of
scandalous gossip, he hardly deserves the implicit trust which
has been often accorded to his indictments of the society of
his day. His generalisations are of the most sweeping kind;
the colours are all dark. He thinks that the number of
decent people in his day is infinitesimally small. And yet
we may reasonably suspect, from his own evidence, that he
often generalised from single cases, that he treated abnormal
specimens as types. His moral ideals cannot have been a
monopoly of his own. In the palace of Nero in the worst
days, there was a pure Octavia as well as a voluptuous Poppaea.
The wife and mother of the gross Vitellius were women of spotless
fame.<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a> And in reading the fierce, unmeasured declamation
of Juvenal, we should never forget that he knew nothing personally
of Pliny or Tacitus, or of the circle which surrounded
Verginius Rufus and Spurinna. He has the same pessimist
theory of human declension which was held by Seneca and by
Tacitus. Every form of crime and sensuality has been rampant
since Rome lost the treasure of poverty, since the days when
silver shone only on the Roman’s arms.<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a> Juvenal’s ideal lies
in that mythical past when a Curius, thrice consul, strode
homeward from the hills, mattock on shoulder, to a meal
of home-grown herbs and bacon served on earthenware.<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a>
It is the luxury of the conquered lands which has relaxed
the Roman fibre, which has introduced a false standard of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg66" id="Pg66" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life, degraded great houses, and flooded the city with an alien
crew of astrologers and grammarians, parasites and pimps.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern criticism has laboured hard to correct some of the
harsher judgments on the luxury and self-indulgence of the
period of the early Empire. Perhaps the scholarly reaction
against an indictment which had degenerated sometimes into
ignorant commonplace, may have been carried here and there
too far. The testimony of Tacitus is explicit that the luxury
of the table reached its height in the hundred years extending
from the battle of Actium to the accession of Vespasian.<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> It
was a period of enormous fortunes spent in enormous waste.
Seneca or Pallas or Narcissus had accumulated wealth probably
three or four times greater than even the fortune of a Crassus
or a Lucullus. The long peace, the safety of the seas, and
the freedom of trade, had made Rome the entrepôt for the
peculiar products and the delicacies of every land from the
British Channel to the Ganges. The costly variety of these
foreign dainties was vulgarly paraded at every great dinner-party.
Palaces, extending almost over the area of a town, were
adorned with marbles from the quarries of Paros, Laconia,
Phrygia, or Numidia,<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> with gilded ceilings and curious panels
changing with the courses of the banquet,<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> with hundreds of
tables of citrus-wood, resting on pillars of ivory, each costing
a moderate fortune, with priceless bronzes and masterpieces
of ancient plate. Nearly a million each year was drained
away to the remoter East, to purchase aromatics and jewels
for the elaborate toilette of the Roman lady.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> Hundreds
of household slaves, each with his minute special function,
anticipated every want, or ministered to every passion of their
masters. Every picturesque or sheltered site on the great lakes,
on the Anio, or the Alban hills, in the Laurentine pine forests,
or on the bays of Campania, was occupied by far-spreading
country seats. Lavish expenditure and luxurious state was
an imperious duty of rank, even without the precept of an
emperor.<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> The senator who paid too low a rent, or rode
along the Appian or Flaminian Way with too scanty a train,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg67" id="Pg67" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>became a marked man, and immediately lost caste.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> These
are the merest commonplace of the social history of the
time.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet in spite of the admitted facts of profusion and self-indulgence,
we may decline to accept Juvenal’s view of the
luxury of the age without some reserve. It is indeed no
apology for the sensuality of a section of the Roman aristocracy
in that day, to point out that the very same excesses made
their appearance two centuries before him, and that they will
be lamented both by Pagan and Christian moralists three
centuries after his death. But these facts suggest a doubt
whether the cancer of luxury had struck so deep as satirists
thought into the vitals of a society which remained for so
many centuries erect and strong. Before the end of the third
century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, began the long series of sumptuary laws which
Tiberius treated as so futile.<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> The elder Pliny and Livy date
the introduction of luxurious furniture from the return of the
army in 188 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, after the campaign in Asia.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> Crassus, who left,
after the most prodigal expenditure, a fortune of £1,700,000,
had a town house which cost over £60,000.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> The lavish
banquets of Lucullus were proverbial, and his villa at Misenum
was valued at £24,000. It was an age when more than
£1000 was given for a slave-cook or a pair of silver cups.<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a>
Macrobius has preserved the menu of a pontifical banquet, at
which Julius Caesar and the Vestals were present, and which in
its costly variety surpassed, as he says, any epicurism of the
reign of Honorius.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> And yet Ammianus and S. Jerome level
very much the same charges against the nobles of the fourth
century,<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a> which satire makes against the nobles of the first.
When we hear the same anathemas of luxury in the days of
Lucullus and in the reign of Honorius, separated by an interval
of more than five centuries, in which the Roman race stamped
itself on the page of history and on the face of nature by the
most splendid achievements of military virtue and of civilising
energy, we are inclined to question either the report of our
authorities, or the satirist’s interpretation of the social facts.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The good faith of the elder Pliny, of Seneca and Juvenal,
need not, indeed, be called in question. But the first two
were men who led by preference an almost ascetic life. The
satirist was a man whose culinary tastes were satisfied by the
kid and eggs and asparagus of his little farm at Tibur.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a>
And the simple abstemious habits of the south, which are
largely the result of climate, tended to throw into more
startling contrast any indulgence of superfluous appetite. It
is true that the conquests which unlocked the hoarded
treasures of eastern monarchies, gave a great shock to the
hardy frugality and self-restraint of the old Roman character,
just as the stern simplicity of Spartan breeding was imperilled
by contact with the laxer life of the Hellespontine towns and the
wealth of the Persian court.<a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a> The Roman aristocracy were for
two centuries exposed to the same temptations as the treasures
of the Incas offered to Pizarro,<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> or the treasures of the Moguls
to Clive. In the wild licence, which prevailed in certain circles
for more than a century, many a fortune and many a character
were wrecked. Yet the result may easily be exaggerated.
Extravagant luxury and self-indulgence is at all times only
possible to a comparatively small number. And luxury, after
all, is a relative term. The luxuries of one age often become
the necessities of the next. There are many articles of food or
dress, which free-trade and science have brought to the doors
of our cottagers, which would have incurred the censure of
the elder Pliny or of Seneca. There are aldermanic banquets
in New York or the city of London in our own day, which far
surpass, in costliness and variety, the banquets of Lucullus or
the pontiff’s feast described by Macrobius. The wealth of
Pallas, Narcissus, or Seneca, was only a fraction of many a
fortune accumulated in the last thirty years in the United
States.<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a> The exaggerated idea of Roman riches and waste has
been further heightened by the colossal extravagance of the
worst emperors and a few of their boon companions and
imitators. But we are apt to forget that these were the
outbreaks of morbid and eccentric character, in which the last
feeble restraints were sapped and swept away by the sense of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg69" id="Pg69" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>having at command the resources of a world. Nero is
expressly described by the historian as a lover of the impossible;<a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a>
and both he and Caligula had floating before their
disordered imaginations the dream of astounding triumphs, even
over the most defiant forces and barriers of nature. There
was much in the extravagance of their courtiers and imitators,
springing from the same love of sensation and display. Rome
was a city of gossip, and the ambition to be talked about,
as the inventor of some new freak of prodigality, was probably
the only ambition of the blasé spendthrift of the time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, after all the deductions of scrupulous criticism, the
profound moral sense of Juvenal has laid bare and painted
with a realistic power, hardly equalled even by Tacitus,
an unhealthy temper in the upper classes, which was full of
peril. He has also revealed, alongside of this decline, a great
social change, we may even call it a crisis, which the historian,
generally more occupied with the great figures on the stage, is
apt to ignore. The decay in the morale and wealth of the
senatorial order, together with the growing power of a new
moneyed class, the rise to opulence of the freedman and the
petty trader, the invasion of Greek and Oriental influences,
and the perilous or hopeful emancipation, especially of women,
from old Roman conventionality, these are the great facts in
the social history of the first century which, under all his
rhetoric, stand out clearly to the eye of the careful student of
the satirist.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The famous piece, in which Juvenal describes an effeminate
Fabius or Lepidus, before the mutilated statues and smoke-stained
pedigree of his house, rattling the dice-box till the
dawn, or sunk in the stupor of debauch at the hour when his
ancestors were sounding their trumpets for the march,<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> has, for
eighteen centuries, inspired many a homily on the vanity
of mere birth. Its moral is now a hackneyed one. But,
when the piece was written, it must have been a powerful
indictment. For the respect for long descent was still deep
in the true Roman, and was gratified by fabulous genealogies
to the end. Pliny extols Trajan for reserving for youths of
illustrious birth the honours due to their race.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> Suetonius

of Apollonius traced himself to Priam.<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> Herodes Atticus

not have accepted such fables, but he was no leveller. He
had a firm belief in moral heredity and the value of tradition.
Plebeian as he was, he had, like Martial, his own old
Roman pride, which poured contempt on the upstarts who,
with the stains of servile birth or base trade upon them, were
crowding the benches of the knights. He would, indeed,
have applauded the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mot</span></span> of Tiberius, that a distinguished man
was his own ancestor;<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> he recalls with pride that one humble

would gladly salute any of their descendants who reproduced
their virtues.

It is a melancholy certainty that a great many of the senatorial
class in Juvenal’s day had fallen very low in all things
essential to the strength of a great caste. Their numbers had

At the same time, prodigality or confiscation had rendered
many of those who survived unable to maintain their rank, and
to bear the social and official burdens which, down to the end
of the Western Empire were rigorously imposed on the great
order. The games of the praetorship in the first century, as in
the fifth,<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> constituted a tax which only a great fortune could
easily bear. Aristocratic poverty became common. As early

subsidise many great families.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> The same policy had been

made an appeal in the Senate for the means of supporting
the dignity of his name. He had received a grant from
Augustus to enable him to rear a family, and four sons were
now waiting at the doors of the Curia to second his prayer.
Hortensius, who was the great rival of Cicero, had possessed
immense wealth. He had many splendid villas, he used to
give dinners in his park, around which the deer would troop
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg72" id="Pg72" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the lute of a slave-Orpheus; he left 10,000 casks of old
Chian in his cellars. His mendicant and spiritless descendant
had to go away with a cold withering refusal from Tiberius,
softened by a contemptuous dole to his sons. The revision
of the senatorial roll by Claudius in 48 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, revealed a portentous
disappearance of old houses of the Republic, and the
gaps had to be filled up from the provinces in the teeth of
aristocratic exclusiveness.<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a> Among the boon companions of
Nero there must have been many loaded with debt, like
Otho and Vitellius. The Corvinus in Juvenal who is keeping
sheep on a Laurentine farm, and his probable kinsman who
obtained a subsidy from Nero, the Fabii and Mamerci
who were dancing and playing the harlequin on the comic
stage, or selling their blood in the arena, must represent
many a wreck of the great houses of the Republic.<a id="noteref_424" name="noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a> Among

knew no lower depth of degradation than in the hungry
adulation which it offered to the heirless rich. Captation
became a regular profession in a society where trade, industry,

men of gentle blood.<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a> It is characteristic of Juvenal that he
places on the same level the legacy-hunter, who would stoop
to any menial service or vicious compliance, with the honest
tradesfolk, in whose ranks, if we may judge by their funerary
inscriptions, was to be found, perhaps, the wholesomest moral
tone in the society of the early Empire.

described a scene of fatuous adulation which, if not true in
fact, is only too true to the character of the time. A huge
mullet, too large for any private table, had been caught in a
bay of the Adriatic. Its captor hastens through winter storms
to lay his spoil at the emperor’s feet. The kitchen of the
Alban palace had no dish large enough for such a monster, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg73" id="Pg73" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a council of trembling senators is hastily summoned to consult
on the emergency. Thither came the gentle Crispus, that
Acilius, whose son was to be the victim of the despot’s
jealousy, Rubrius tainted with a nameless crime, the bloated
Montanus, and Crispinus, once an Egyptian slave, now a
vulgar exquisite, reeking with unguents. There, too, was the
informer whose whisper stabbed like a stiletto, the lustful,
blind Catullus, and the arch flatterer Veiento, who had
revelled at the Gargantuan feasts of Nero from noon till
midnight. These are worthy brethren of the assembly who
stabbed Proculus to death with their stiles at the nod of the

Many things had contributed to the degradation of the
senatorial character. The dark and tortuous policy of
Tiberius tended, indeed, to absolutism; yet he still maintained
a tone of deference to the Senate, and sometimes, with cold
good sense, repelled a too eager adulation.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> But, in the reigns
of Caligula and Nero, the great order had to submit to the
deepest personal degradation, and were tempted, or compelled
by their masters to violate every instinct of Roman dignity.
The wild epileptic frenzy of Caligula, who spared not the
virtue of his sisters,<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> as he boasted of his own incestuous

sacrifices, who, as another Endymion, called the Moon to his

and Virgil and Livy, was not likely to spare the remnant of
self-respect still left in his nobles.<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> He gave an immense
impetus to the rage for singing, dancing, and acting,<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> for
chariot-driving and fighting in the arena, not unknown before,
which Juvenal and Tacitus brand as the most flagrant sign of
degenerate morals. There was indeed a great conflict of
sentiment under the early Empire as to some of these arts.
Julius Caesar had encouraged or permitted Roman senators
and knights to fight in the gladiatorial combats, and a Laberius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg74" id="Pg74" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to act in his own play.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> But a decree of the Senate, not long
afterwards, had placed a ban on these exhibitions by men of
noble rank.<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> Tiberius, who was, beyond anything, a haughty
aristocrat, at a later date intervened to save the dignity of
the order.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> But the rage of the rabble for these spectacles
had undoubtedly caught many in the ranks of the upper
class. And Caligula and Nero<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> found, only too easily, youths
of birth and breeding, but ruined fortune, who were ready to
exhibit themselves for a welcome <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">douceur</span></span>, or to gain the
favour of the prince, or even to bring down the applause
of the crowded benches of the amphitheatre or the circus.
Yet the old Roman feeling must have been very persistent,
when a man like Domitian, who posed as a puritan, found
it politic to remove from the Senate one who had disgraced
his order by dancing in the pantomime, and even
laid his interdict on all public theatrical performances.<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>
The revels and massacres and wild debauchery of Nero did
not so much to hasten his destruction as his singing his
catches to the lute, or appearing in the parts of the incestuous
Canace and the matricide Orestes.<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> From every part of the
world, in all the literature of the time, there is a chorus of
astounded indignation against the prince who could stoop to
pit himself against Greek players and singers at Delphi or
Olympia. Juvenal has been reproached for putting the chariot-driving
of Damasippus in the same category with the Verrine
plunder of provinces.<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> He is really the exponent of old
Roman sentiment. And it may be doubted whether, from the
Roman point of view, Juvenal might not justify himself to
his critics. Even in our own emancipated age, we might be
pardoned for feeling a shock if an English prime minister rode
his own horse at the Derby, or appeared in a risky part on the
boards of the Gaiety. And the collective sense of senatorial
self-respect was too precious to a Roman patriot and moralist,
to be flung away for mere love of sport, or in a fit of spurious
artistic enthusiasm. Nero, and in an even lower fashion
Caligula, were rebels against old Roman conventional restraints,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg75" id="Pg75" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and it is possible that some of the hideous tales about them,
which were spread in the <span class="tei tei-q">“circuli,”</span> may have been the vengeance
of Roman pride on shameless social revolutionaries, who
paraded their contempt for old-fashioned dignity and for social
tradition. Nero was never so happy as when he was deafened
with applause, and smothered with roses at the Greek festivals.
He had once predicted for him a monarchy in those regions of
the East,<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> where he would have escaped from the tradition of
old Roman puritanism, and combined all the ingenious sensuality
of Syria with the doubtful artistic taste of a decadent
Hellenism. The cold haughty refinement of senatorial circles
of the old régime, and the rude honest virtue of the plebeian
soldiery,<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> rightly mistrusted this false sensational artist on the
throne of the world.

Art, divorced from moral ideals, may become a dangerous
thing. The emperor might spend the morning with his

the roses and music hardly veiled the grossness of excess. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“noctes Neronis”</span> made many a debauchee and scattered many
a senatorial fortune.<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> And amid all this elaborate luxury and
splendour of indulgence, there was a strange return to the
naturalism of vice and mere blackguardism. A Messalina or
a Nero or a Petronius developed a curious taste for the low
life that reeks and festers in the taverns and in the stews.
Bohemianism for a time became the fashion.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> Its very grossness
was a stimulant to appetites jaded with every diabolical
refinement of vicious ingenuity. The distinguished dinner
party, with the emperor at their head, sallied forth to see how
the people were living in the slums. Many a scene from these
midnight rambles has probably been preserved in the tainted,
yet brilliant, pages of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span>. Petronius had probably
often plunged with Nero after night-fall into those low dens,
where slave minions and sailors and the obscene priests of the
great Mother were roistering together, or sunk in the slumber
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg76" id="Pg76" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of debauch.<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> These elegant aristocrats found their sport in
rudely assaulting quiet citizens returning from dinner, or
plundering some poor huckster’s stall in the Suburra, or insulting
a lady in her chair. In the fierce faction fights of the
theatre, where stones and benches were flying, the Emperor
had once the distinction of breaking a praetor’s head.<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a> It was

The demoralisation of a section of the upper class under the
bad emperors must have certainly involved the degradation of
many women. And one of the most brilliant and famous of
Juvenal’s Satires is devoted to this unsavoury subject. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“Legend of Bad Women”</span> is a graphic picture, and yet it
suffers from a defect which spoils much of Juvenal’s work.
Full of realistic power, with an undoubted foundation of truth,
it is too vehement and sweeping in its censures to gain full
credence. It is also strangely wanting in balance and due order
of idea.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a> The problem of marriage is illustrated by a series
of sketches of female manners, which are very disconnected,
and, indeed, sometimes inconsistent. Thorough depravity,
superstition, and ignorant devotion, interest in literature and
public affairs, love of gymnastic and decided opinions on
Virgil—in fact, vices, innocent hobbies, and laudable tastes are
all thrown together in a confused indictment. The bohemian
man of letters had heard many a scandal about great ladies,
some of them true, others distorted and exaggerated by
prurient gossip, after passing through a hundred tainted
imaginations. In his own modest class, female morality, as
we may infer from the Inscriptions and other sources, was
probably as high as it ever was, as high as the average
morality of any age.<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a> There were aristocratic families, too,

and women, in some circles was actually rising. In the families
of Seneca, of Tacitus, of Pliny and Plutarch, there were, not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg77" id="Pg77" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only the most spotless and high minded women, there were
also men with a rare conception of temperance and mutual
love, of reverence for a pure wedlock, to which S. Jerome and
S. Augustine would have given their benediction. Even Ovid,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“debauchee of the imagination,”</span> writes to his wife, from
his exile in the Scythian wilds, in the accents of the purest
affection.<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> And, amid all the lubricity of his pictures of
gallantry, he has not lost the ideal of a virgin heart, which
repels and disarms the libertine by the spell of an impregnable
purity.<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> Plutarch’s ideal of marriage, at once severe

the duty of suckling and personally caring for their infants.<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a>
Seneca and Musonius, who lived through the reign of Nero,
are equally peremptory in demanding a like continence
from men and from women. And Musonius severely condemns
concubinage and vagrant amours of every kind, the
man guilty of seduction sins not only against another, but
against his own soul.<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> Dion Chrysostom was probably the first
of the ancients to raise a clear voice against the traffic in frail
beauty which has gone on pitilessly from age to age. Nothing
could exceed the vehemence with which he assails an evil
which he regards as not only dishonouring to human nature,
but charged with the poison of far spreading corruption.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>
Juvenal’s ideal of purity, therefore, is not peculiar to himself.
The great world was bad enough, but there was another world
beside that whose infamy Juvenal has immortalised.

It is also to be observed that Juvenal seems to be quite
as much under the influence of old Roman conventionality as of
permanent moral ideals. He condemns eccentricities, or mere
harmless aberrations from old-fashioned rules of propriety, as
ruthlessly as he punishes lust and crime. The blue-stocking

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The truth is that Juvenal is as much shocked by the <span class="tei tei-q">“new
woman”</span> as he is by the vicious woman. He did not understand,
or he could not acquiesce in the great movement for the
emancipation of women, which had set in long before his time,
and which, like all such movements, brought evil with it as
well as good. There is perhaps nothing more striking in
the social history of Rome than the inveterate conservatism
of Roman sentiment in the face of accomplished change.
Such moral rigidity is almost necessarily prone to pessimism.
The Golden Age lies in the past; the onward sweep of
society seems to be always moving towards the abyss.
The ideal past of the Roman woman lay more than two
centuries and a half behind the time when Juvenal was
born. The old Roman matron was, by legal theory, in the
power of her husband, yet assured by religion and sentiment a
dignified position in the family, and treated with profound, if
somewhat cold, respect; she was busied with household cares,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg79" id="Pg79" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and wanting in the lighter graces and charms, austere, self-contained,
and self-controlled. But this severe ideal had
begun to fade even in the days of the elder Cato.<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href="#note_468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a> And there
is hardly a fault or vice attributed by Juvenal to the women
of Domitian’s reign, which may not find parallel in the nine or
ten generations before Juvenal penned his great indictment
against the womanhood of his age. The Roman lady’s irritable
pride of birth is at least as old as the rivalry of the two Fabiae
in the fourth century.<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> The elder Cato dreaded a rich wife
as much as Juvenal,<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> and satirised as bitterly the pride and
gossip and luxury of the women of his time. Their love of
gems and gold ornaments and many-coloured robes and richly
adorned carriages, is attested by Plautus and the impotent legislation
of C. Oppius.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> Divorce and ghastly crime in the noblest
families were becoming common in the days of the Second Punic
War. About the same time began that emancipation of
women from the jealous restraints of Roman law, which was to
be carried further in the Antonine age.<a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a> The strict forms of
marriage, which placed the wife in the power of her husband,
fell more and more into desuetude. Women attained more
absolute control over their property, and so much capital
became concentrated in their hands that, about the middle of
the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, the Voconian law was passed to prohibit
bequests to them, with the usual futile result of such
legislation.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href="#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> Yet the old ideal of the industrious housewife
never died out, and Roman epitaphs for ages record that the
model matron was a wool-worker and a keeper at home. A
senator of the reign of Honorius praises his daughter for the same
homely virtues.<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a> But from the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> the education
of the Roman girl of the higher classes underwent a great
change.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> Dancing, music, and the higher accomplishments
were no longer under a ban, although they were still suspected
by people of the old-fashioned school. Boys and girls received
the same training from the grammarian, and read their Homer
and Ennius together.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a> There were women in the time of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg80" id="Pg80" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lucretius, as in the time of Juvenal, who interlarded their
conversation with Greek phrases.<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> Cornelia, the wife of

had some tincture of philosophy.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> The daughter of Atticus,
who became the wife of Agrippa, was placed under the tuition
of a freedman, who, as too often happened, seems to have
abused his trust.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a> Even in the gay circle of Ovid, there
were learned ladies, or ladies who wished to be thought so.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a>
Even Martial reckons culture among the charms of a woman.
Seneca maintained that women have an equal capacity for cultivation
with men.<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> Thus the blue-stocking of Juvenal, for whom
he has so much contempt, had many an ancestress for three
centuries, as she will have many a daughter till the end of the
Western Empire.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> Even in philosophy, usually the last study
to attract the female mind, Roman ladies were asserting
an equal interest. Great ladies of the Augustan court, even
the empress herself, had their philosophic directors,<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> and
the fashion perhaps became still more general under M.
Aurelius. Epictetus had met ladies who were enthusiastic
admirers of the Platonic Utopia, but the philosopher rather
slyly attributes their enthusiasm to the absence of rigorous
conjugal relations in the Ideal Society.<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> Even in the field of
authorship, women were claiming equal rights. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Memoirs of
Agrippina</span></span> was one of the authorities of Tacitus.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> The poems of
Sulpicia, mentioned by Martial,<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> were read in Gaul in the days

affectation, by Balbilla, a friend of the wife of Hadrian, can
still be read on the Colossus of Memnon.<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> Calpurnia, the wife
of Pliny, may not have been an author; but she shared all
Pliny’s literary tastes; she set his poems to music, and gave
him the admiration of a good wife, if not of an impartial critic.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Juvenal feels as much scorn for the woman who is interested
in public affairs and the events on the frontier,<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> as he
feels for the woman who presumes to balance the merits of
Virgil and Homer. And here he is once more at war with a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg81" id="Pg81" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>great movement towards the equality of the sexes. From the
days of Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, to the days of
Placidia, the sister of Honorius, Roman women exercised, from
time to time, a powerful, and not always wholesome, influence
on public affairs. The politic Augustus discussed high matters
of state with Livia.<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> The reign of Claudius was a reign of
women and freedmen. Tacitus records, with a certain distaste
for the innovation, that Agrippina sat enthroned beside Claudius
on a lofty tribunal, to receive the homage of the captive Caractacus.<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a>
Nero emancipated himself from the grasping ambition
of his mother only by a ghastly crime. The influence of
Caenis on Vespasian in his later days tarnished his fame.<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a>
The influence of women in provincial administration was also
becoming a serious force. In the reign of Tiberius, Caecina
Severus, with the weight of forty years’ experience of camps, in
a speech before the Senate, denounced the new-fangled custom
of the wives of generals and governors accompanying them
abroad, attending reviews of troops, mingling freely with the
soldiers, and taking an active part in business, which was not
always favourable to pure administration.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a> In the inscriptions
of the first and second centuries, women appear in a more
wholesome character as <span class="tei tei-q">“mothers of the camp,”</span> or patronesses
of municipal towns and corporations.<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> They have statues dedicated

We are reminded of the <span class="tei tei-q">“chapter of matrons”</span> who visited
Agrippina with their censure,<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> and another female senate, under
Elagabalus, which dealt with minute questions of precedence
and graded etiquette.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> On the walls of Pompeii female admirers

Although he was probably a very light believer in the old

Juvenal had all the old Roman prejudice against those eastern
worships which captivated so many women of his day. And, here
again, the satirist is assailing a movement which had set in long
before he wrote, and which was destined to gain immense impetus
and popularity in the two following centuries. The eunuch
priests of the Great Mother, with their cymbals and Phrygian
tiaras, had appeared in Italy in the last years of the Hannibalic
War.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a> The early years of the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> were convulsed

we can see the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d’être</span></span> of what the satirist regarded
as religious aberrations, the full treatment of which must
be reserved for another chapter. The world was in the
throes of a religious revolution, and eagerly in quest of some
fresh vision of the Divine, from whatever quarter it might
dawn. The cults of the East seemed to satisfy cravings and
emotions, which found no resting-place in the national religion.
Their ritual appealed to the senses and imagination, while their
mysteries seemed to promise a revelation of God and immortality.
Their strange mixture of the sensuous and the ascetic
was specially adapted to fascinate weak women who had deeply
sinned, and yet occasionally longed to repent. The repentance
indeed was often shallow enough; the fasting and mortification
were compatible with very light morals.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a> There were the gravest
moral abuses connected with such worships as that of Magna
Mater. It is well known that the temples of Isis often
became places of assignation and guilty intrigue.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> An infatuated

In spite of the political extinction of the Jewish race, its
numbers and influence grew in Italy. The very destruction
of the Holy Place and the external symbols of Jewish worship
threw a more impressive air of mystery around the dogmas

had only vague conceptions.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> The Jews, from the time of

inactivity.”</span> In truth, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Jewish life”</span> was a
description which might cover many shades of belief and
practice in religion, including Christianity itself. The secret
worship of a dim, mysterious Power, Who was honoured
by no imposing rites, a spirit of detachment and quietism,
which shrank from games and spectacles and the scenes of
fashion, and nursed the dream of a coming kingdom which
was not of this world, excited the suspicion and contempt
of the coarse, strenuous Roman nature. Yet, in the gloom
and deep corruption of that sombre time, such a life of
retreat and renunciation had a strange charm for naturally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg84" id="Pg84" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pious souls, especially among women. There were indeed
many degrees of conformity to the religion of Palestine.
While some were attracted by its more spiritual side, others
confined themselves to an observance of the Sabbath, which
became very common in some quarters of Rome under the
Empire. The children, as Juvenal tells us, were sometimes
trained to a complete conformity to the law of Moses.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a>
But Juvenal is chiefly thinking of the mendicant population
from Palestine who swarmed in the neighbourhood of the
Porta Capena and the grove of the Muses, practising all the
arts which have appealed in all ages to superstitious women.
Thus the Judaism of the times of Nero or Domitian might
cover anything from the cunning of the gipsy fortune-teller
to the sad, dreaming quietism of Pomponia Graecina.<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a>

Yet it must be admitted that, although Juvenal, in his
attacks on women, has mixed up very real vice with superstition
and mere innocent eccentricity, or the explosive energy
of a new freedom, the real vices of many women of his time
are a melancholy fact. The Messalinas and Poppaeas had
many imitators and companions in their own class. It is
true that even the licentious fancy of Ovid and Martial
generally spares the character of the unmarried girl. She was,
in the darkest times, as a rule, carefully guarded from the
worst corruptions of the spectacles,<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a> or from the reckless

and danger often began on her wedding-day. That there was
a high ideal of pure and happy marriage, even in the times
of the greatest licence, we know from Pliny and Plutarch,

before the child-bride, when she was launched upon the great

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg85" id="Pg85" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unnatural indulgence, and ready to concede the conjugal
liberty which he claimed, was a perilous trial to virtue. The
bonds of old Roman marriage had, for ages, been greatly
relaxed, and the Roman lady of independent fortune and
vigorous, highly trained intellect, could easily find consolation
for marital neglect. From Seneca to S. Jerome, the foppish
procurator of the great lady was a dangerous and suspected
person,<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> and not always without good cause. Surrounded by an
army of slaves and the other obsequious dependents of a great
house, treated with profound deference, and saluted with the
pompous titles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">domina</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regina</span></span>, the great lady’s lightest
caprice became law.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> Costly jewels and the rarest luxuries of the
toilet poured in upon her from regions which were only visited
by the captains of Red Sea merchantmen, or by some Pythagorean
ascetic seeking the fountains of the wisdom of the East.<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a>

The political life of Rome had been extinguished by a
jealous despotism, but social life in the higher ranks was never
so intense and so seductive, and women had their full share in
it. Ladies dined out regularly with their husbands, even at
the emperor’s table,<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a> and they were liable to be assailed by
the artistic wiles of which Ovid taught the secret, or by the
brutal advances of the lawless Caligula.<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a> It was a time when
people loved to meet anywhere, under the trees of the Campus
Martius, in the colonnades of the theatre, or round the
seats of the public squares. Everywhere were to be seen
those groups which spared no reputation, not even the emperor’s.
And behind the chair of the young matron often
hovered the dangerous exquisite, who could hum in a whisper
the latest suggestive song from Alexandria or Gades,<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> who
knew the pedigree of every racehorse and the secret of every
intrigue. It is at such scenes that Tacitus is probably
glancing when he says that in Germany no one makes a jest
of vice, or calls the art of corruption the fashion of the world;<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg86" id="Pg86" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Augustus had, indeed, set apart the upper seats for women in

the sexes freely mingled. It was there, while the factions of the
red and blue were shouting themselves hoarse, Ovid pointed
out to his pupil in gallantry, that he had his fairest chance of
making a dangerous impression.<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a> Yet even Ovid is half inclined

the old mythology, the loves of Pasiphae or the loves of Leda,
were enacted to the life, or told with a nakedness of language,
compared with which even Martial might seem chaste.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> Not
less degrading were the gladiatorial shows, so lavishly provided
by Augustus and Trajan, as well as by Caligula and Domitian,
at which the Vestals had a place of honour.<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> It is little
wonder that women accustomed to take pleasure in the sufferings
and death of brave men, should be capable of condemning
their poor slave women to torture or the lash for a sullen look,
or a half-heard murmur. The grossness with which Juvenal
describes the effect of the stage on the morals of women savours
of the Suburra.<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a> But of the poisonous character of these performances
there can be no doubt. And actors, musicians, and
gladiators became a danger to the peace of households, as well
as to the peace of the streets. The artistes of the pantomime
were sternly suppressed both by Tiberius and Domitian, and
not without good cause.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a> One famous dancer had the fatal

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg87" id="Pg87" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was demanding equal chastity in man and woman, the new

a servile <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">liaison</span></span>. A decree of Vespasian’s reign, which his

These illustrations from other authorities may serve
towards a judicial estimate of Juvenal’s famous satire on
women. That it is not a prurient invention is proved by the
pages of Tacitus and Suetonius and the records of Roman
morals for more than two centuries. On the other hand, it
must be read with some reservations. Juvenal is a rhetorician
with a fiery temperament, who will colour and exaggerate, if
he will not invent. He is intensely prejudiced and conventional,
a man to whom desertion of ancient usage is almost as
bad as a breach of the moral law, a man incapable of seeing
that the evils of a new social movement may be more than compensated
by the good which it brings. Moreover, the graver
vices which he depicts with so much realistic power were
certainly not so general as he implies. It is to be suspected
that single instances of abnormal depravity have swelled in
his heated imagination till they have become types of whole
classes of sinners. At the worst, these vices infected only a
comparatively small class, idle, luxurious, enervated by the
slave system, depraved by the example of a vicious court.
The very scorn and indignation with which Juvenal pillories
the aristocratic debauchee reveal the existence of a higher
standard of virtue. Both the literature and the inscriptions
of that age make us acquainted with a very different kind of
woman. Over against the Hippia or Saufeia or Messalina of
Juvenal we must set the pure and cultivated women whom
we meet in the pages of Pliny or Tacitus, or the poor soldier’s
concubine in the Inscriptions, who has all the self-denying love
and virtue of our own cottagers’ wives.<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a>

Just as Juvenal misunderstood the movement of female
emancipation, which was to culminate in the legislation of the
Antonine age, so has he misconceived some other great social
movements of his time. Two in particular, the invasion of the
new Hellenism and the rise of the Freedmen, he anathematises
with the scorn and old Roman prejudice of the elder Cato.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was nothing new in the invasion of Hellenism in the
time of Juvenal. Nearly three hundred years before his day,
the narrow conservatism of ancient Rome was assailed by
the cosmopolitan culture of Hellas, which it alternately hated
and admired. The knowledge of Greek was widely diffused
in Italy in the time of the Hannibalic war.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> Almost the last
Roman of the ancient breed stooped in his old age to learn
Greek, in order to train his son in the culture of the world.<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a>
But there were two different aspects of Hellenism. There
was the Hellenism represented by Homer and Plato and
Chrysippus; and there was the Hellenism of the low comic
stage, of the pimp and parasite. And there were reactions
against the lower Greek influences long before the days of
Juvenal. Cicero, who did more than any man of his race
to translate Greek thought into Roman idiom, yet expressed
as bitter a contempt as Juvenal’s for the fickle, supple,
histrionic Greek adventurer.<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> Juvenal is not waging war
with that nobler Hellenism which had furnished models and
inspiration to the great writers of the Augustan age, and
which was destined to refashion Italian culture in the generation
following his death. The emperors, from Julius Caesar
to M. Aurelius, were, with few exceptions, trained in the
literature of Greece, and some of them gave a great impetus to
Greek culture in the West. Augustus delighted in the Old
Comedy, entertained Greek philosophers in his house, and
sprinkled his private letters to Tiberius with Greek quotations.<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a>
Tiberius, although he had lived at Rhodes in his youth, seems
to show less sympathy for the genius of Greece.<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> Caligula also
can hardly be claimed as a Hellenist. Although he had once
a wild dream of restoring the palace of Polycrates, and one,
more sane, of a canal through the Corinthian Isthmus, he also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg89" id="Pg89" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thought of wiping out the memory of the poems of Homer.<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a>
Dr. Mahaffy is probably right in treating Claudius as the first
really Hellenist emperor.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a> Like our own James I., Claudius
was a learned and very ludicrous person. Yet he was perhaps
not so contemptible a character as he is painted by Suetonius.
He had, at any rate, the merit of being a lover of Greek literature,<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a>
and he heaped honour on the country which gave it birth.<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a>
He used to quote Homer in his speeches in the Senate, and
he composed histories in the Greek language, which, by an
imperial ordinance, were to be read aloud regularly in the
Museum of Alexandria.<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> In spite of the vices and pompous
follies of Nero, his phil-Hellenism seems to have been a genuine
and creditable impulse. His visits to the Greek festivals, and
his share in the competitions, were not all mere vanity. He
had a futile passion for fame as an artist, and he sought the
applause of the race which had a real artistic tradition.<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a>
When we reach the plebeian Flavian race, Hellenism is still
favoured. The bluff soldier, Vespasian, had an adequate command
of the Greek language, and was the first emperor who
gave liberal endowments to Greek rhetoric.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> His son
Domitian, that puzzling enigma, the libertine who tried to
revive the morality of the age of Cato, the man who was said,
but most improbably, to confine his reading to the memoirs
of Tiberius, founded a quinquennial festival, with competitions,
on the Greek model, in music, gymnastic, and horsemanship.
By drawing on the inexhaustible stores of Alexandria, he
also repaired the havoc which had been wrought in the Roman
libraries by fire.<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> Already in Juvenal’s life the brilliant
sophistic movement had set in which was destined to carry
the literary charm of Hellenism throughout the West. From
the close of the first century there appeared in its full bloom
that ingenious technique of style, that power of conquering
all the difficulties of a worn-out or trifling subject, that
delicate command of all varieties of rhythm, which carried the
travelling sophist through a series of triumphs wherever he
wandered. Classical Latin literature about the same time came
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg90" id="Pg90" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to a mysterious end. The only authors of any merit in the
second century wrote in both languages indifferently.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> And
the great Emperor, who closes our period, preferred to leave
his inner thoughts to posterity in Greek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Juvenal, however, was not thinking of this great literary
movement. Like so many of his literary predecessors, who
had been formed by the loftier genius of the Greek past,
like Plautus and Cicero, he vented his rage on a degenerate
Hellenism. His shafts were levelled at the suttlers and camp-followers
of the invading army from the East. The phenomena
of Roman social history are constantly repeating themselves
for centuries. And one of the most curious examples of
perpetuity of social sentiment is the hatred and scorn for the
Greek or Levantine character, from the days of Plautus and
the elder Cato to the days of the poet Claudian.<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> For more
than 600 years, the Roman who had borrowed his best culture,
his polish and ideas from the Greek, was ready to sneer at
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Greekling.”</span> The conquerors of Macedon could never
forgive their own conquest by Greek knowledge and versatility,
by which old Roman victories in the field had been avenged.
And, as the pride of the imperial race grew with the consciousness
of great achievements, the political degradation and
economic decay of Greece and Greek-speaking lands produced
a type of character which combined the old cleverness and
keenness of intellect with the moral defects of an impoverished
and subject race. Something of Roman contempt for the Greek
must be set down to that national prejudice and difference of
temperament, which made our ancestors treat the great French
nation, with all its brilliant gifts and immense contributions
to European culture, as a race of posturing dancing-masters.<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a>
Such prejudices are generally more intense in the lower than
in the upper and the cultivated classes. Juvenal, indeed, was
a cultivated man, who knew Greek literature, and had been
formed by Greek rhetors in the schools. But he was also a
Roman plebeian, with that pride of race which is often as deep
in the plebeian as in the aristocrat. He gives voice to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg91" id="Pg91" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feeling of his class when he indignantly laments that the true-born
Roman, whose infancy has drunk in the air of the
Aventine, should have to yield place to the supple, fawning
stranger, who has come with the same wind as the figs and
prunes. The Orontes is pouring its pollutions into the Tiber.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a>
Every trade and profession, from the master of the highest
studies down to the rope-dancer and the pander, is crowded
with hungry, keen-witted adventurers from the East. Every
island of the Aegean, every city of Asia, is flooding Rome with
its vices and its venal arts.<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a> Quickness of intellect and
depravity of morals, the brazen front and the ready tongue are
driving into the shade the simple, unsophisticated honesty of
the old Roman breed. At the morning receptions of the great
patron, the poor Roman client, who has years of honest, quiet
service to show, even the impoverished scion of an ancient
consular line, are pushed aside by some sycophant from the
Euphrates,<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> who can hardly conceal the brand of recent
servitude upon him. These men, by their smooth speech,
their effrontery and ready wit, their infinite capacity for
assuming every mood and humouring every caprice of the
patron, are creeping into the recesses of great houses, worming
out their secrets, and mastering their virtue.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> Rome is

Much of this indictment, as we have said, is the offspring
of prejudice and temperament. But there was a foundation
of truth under the declamation of Juvenal. The higher
education of Roman youth had for generations been chiefly
in the hands of men of Greek culture, from the days of
Ennius and Crates of Mallus, before the third Punic War.<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a>

a Greek art which was seldom practised by Romans.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a> Julius

also stimulated the immigration of foreign practitioners. The

Astrology, which was the aristocratic form of divination,
and involved in many a dark intrigue of the early Empire, was a
Greek as well as a Chaldaean art. The name of the practitioner
often reveals his nationality. The Seleucus<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a> and Ptolemaeus
who affected to guide the fate of Otho, and the Ascletarion of
Domitian’s reign,<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> are only representatives of a nameless crowd.
And their strange power is seen in that tale of a Greek
diviner, Pammenes, in the last years of Nero, whose horoscopes
led to the tragic end of P. Anteius and Ostorius Scapula.<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> In
other countless arts of doubtful repute, which ministered to the
pleasure or amusement of the crowd, the Greek was always
an adept. But it was his success as a courtier and accomplished
flatterer of the great, which chiefly roused the scornful
hatred of Juvenal and his fellows. The <span class="tei tei-q">“adulandi gens prudentissima,”</span>
would hardly have been guilty of the simple and
obvious grossness of flattery which the rhetoric of Juvenal
attributes to them.<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> They knew their trade better than the
Roman plebeian. It was an old and highly rewarded profession
in Greece, and had often been the theme of Greek moralists.
Plutarch wrote an elaborate treatise on the difference between
the sycophant and the true friend, in which he seems almost
to exhaust the wily resources of the pretender. Lucian, with
his delicate irony, seems almost to raise the Greek skill in
adulation to the level of a fine art.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> And the polished and
versatile Greek, with his lively wit, his delicate command of
expression, his cool audacity, and his unscrupulousness, was a
formidable rival of the coarser Roman parasite celebrated in
Latin comedy. We can well imagine that the young Greek,
fresh from the schools of Ionia, was a livelier companion at
dinner than the proud Roman man of letters who snatched
the dole and disdained himself for receiving it.

There is perhaps no phase of Roman society in Domitian’s
day which we know more intimately than the life of the client.
It is photographed, in all its sordid slavery, by both Juvenal
and Martial. And Martial himself is perhaps the best example
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg94" id="Pg94" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a man of genius submitting, with occasional intervals of
proud rebellion,<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> to a degradation which in our eyes no poverty
could excuse. The client of the early Empire was a totally
different person from the client of Republican times. In
the days of freedom, the tie of patron and client was rather
that of clansman and chief; it was justified by political and
social necessity, and ennobled by feelings of loyalty and mutual
obligation. Under the Empire, the relation was tainted by
the selfish materialism of the age; it had seldom any
trace of sentiment. The rich man was expected to have a
humble train of dependents to maintain his rank and consequence.
There was a host of needy people ready to do him
such service. The hungry client rushed to his patron’s morning
reception, submitted to all his coldness and caprice, or to the
insolence of his menials, followed his chair through the streets,
and ran on his errands, for the sake of a miserable alms in
money or in kind.<a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> The payment was sometimes supplemented
by a cast-off cloak, or an invitation at the last moment to fill
a place at dinner, when perhaps it could not be accepted.<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> In
the train which the great man gathered about him, to swell his
importance, were to be seen, not only the starving man of
letters, the loafer and mere mendicant, but the sons of ruined

consular rank who had a clientèle of their own.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a>

Nothing throws a more lurid light on the economic
condition of Italy in the time of the early Empire than this
form of pensioned dependence. The impression which we
derive from Juvenal and Martial is that of a society divided
between a small class of immensely wealthy people, and an
almost starving proletariat.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> Poverty seems almost universal,
except in the freedman class, who by an industrial energy and
speculative daring, which were despised by the true-born
Roman, were now rapidly rising to opulence. The causes of
this plebeian indigence can only be glanced at here. The
agricultural revolution, which ruined the small freeholders and
created the plantation system,<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a> had driven great numbers of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg95" id="Pg95" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>once prosperous farmers to the capital, to depend on the
granaries of the State, or on the charity of a wealthy patron.
Such men were kept in poverty and dependence by that general
contempt for trade and industrial pursuits which always prevails
in a slave-owning society. Many of the greatest families
had been reduced to poverty by proscription and confiscation.
A great noble might be keeping sheep on a Laurentine farm,
if he could not win a pension from the grace of the Emperor.
At the same time, from various causes, what we should call
the liberal professions, with the doubtful exception of medicine,
tortured those engaged in them by the contrast between ambitious
hopes and the misery of squalid poverty. <span class="tei tei-q">“Make your son an
auctioneer or an undertaker rather than an advocate or a man
of letters”</span> is the advice of Martial and Juvenal, and of the
shrewd vulgar guests of Trimalchio.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> Any mean and malodorous
trade will be more lucrative than the greatest knowledge and
culture. The rich literary amateur, who should have been a
Maecenas, in that age became an author himself, composed his
own Thebaid or Codrid, and would only help the poor man of
genius by the loan of an unfurnished hall for a reading.<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> The

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg96" id="Pg96" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>slaves and dependents, down to the courts of the Centumviri.
The poor pleader must hire or borrow purple robes
and jewelled rings, if he is to compete with them. And in
the end, he may find his honorarium for a day’s hard pleading
to be a leg of pork, a jar of tunnies, or a few flasks of cheap
wine. In this materialised society all the prizes go to the
coarser qualities; there is nothing but neglect and starvation
before taste and intellect. And poverty is punished by being
forced to put on the show of wealth.<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> That stately person in

In such a society, where the paths of honest industry seemed
closed to the poor, or as yet undiscovered, the great problem
was how to secure without labour a share of the wealth which
was monopolised by the few. The problem was solved by the
obsequiousness of the client, or by the arts of the will-hunter.
Owing to celibacy and vice, childlessness in that age was extraordinarily
common in the upper class. In a society of <span class="tei tei-q">“ambitious
poverty,”</span> a society where poverty was unable, or where
it disdained, to find the path to competence through honest toil,
the wealthy, without natural heirs, offered a tempting prey to
the needy adventurer. Captation by every kind of mean flattery,
or vicious service, became a recognised profession. In the
Croton of Petronius there are only two classes, the rich and
the sycophant, the hunters and the hunted.<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a> Even men of

the captator, made it almost an honour to be beset on a <a name="corr96" id="corr96" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">sick-bed</span> by these rapacious sycophants. One of the darkest and
most repulsive features in that putrescent society was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg97" id="Pg97" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>social value which attached to a vicious and shameful childlessness.
A morose and unlovely old age could thus gather
around it a little court of dependents and pretended friends,
such as a career of great achievement would hardly attract.
There have been few more loathsome characters than the
polished hypocrite by the sick-bed of his prey, shedding tears
of feigned sympathy, while with eager eyes he is noting every
symptom of the approaching end.<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a>

Juvenal and Petronius, the embittered plebeian, and the
cynical, fastidious epicure of Nero’s court, alike treat their age
as utterly corrupted and vulgarised by the passion for money;

Martial probably the most resonant note is the cry of the poor—<span class="tei tei-q">“How
long.”</span> Yet, after all, it is not a fierce cry of revolt;
against that highly organised and centralised society the disinherited
never dreamed of rebellion, even when the Goths were
under the walls. It is rather an appeal, though often a bitter and
angry appeal, for pity and a modest share in a wasted abundance.
In the poems of Juvenal and Martial, as in the sentiment of
the colleges and municipalities for generations, the one hope for
the mass of helpless indigence lay in awaking the generosity and
charity of the rich. The rich, as we shall see in another
chapter, admitted the obligation, and responded to the claim,
often in the most lavish fashion. A long line of emperors not
only fed the mob of the capital, but squandered the resources
of the State in providing gross and demoralising amusements
for them.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> Under the influence of the Stoic teaching of the
brotherhood of man and the duty of mutual help, both private
citizens and benevolent princes, from Nero to M. Aurelius,
created charitable foundations for the orphan and the

strong, but a spirit of benevolence was in the air, even in the
days of Juvenal; and the constant invectives of poet or philosopher
against wealth and luxury are not so much the sign
of a growing selfishness, as of a spreading sense of the duty
of the fortunate to the miserable. Although the literary
men seem never to have thought of any economic solution of
the social problem, through the tapping of fresh sources of
wealth from which all might draw, yet there can be no doubt
that there was, at least in provincial cities, a great industrial
movement in the Antonine age, which gave wealth to some,
and a respectable competence to many. The opulent freedman
and the contented artisan have left many a memorial in the
inscriptions. Yet the movement had not solved the social
problem in the days of Lucian, as it has not solved it after
seventeen centuries. The cry of the poor against the selfish
rich, which rings in the ears of the detached man of letters at
the end of the Antonine age, will still ring in the ears of the
ascetic Salvianus, when the Germans have passed the Rhine.<a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href="#note_607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scorn and hatred of Juvenal for wealth and its vices is
natural to a class which was too proud to struggle out of poverty,
by engaging in the industries which it despised. And the freedman,
who occupied the vacant field, and rose to opulence, is
even more an object of hatred to Juvenal and Martial than
the recreant noble or the stingy patron. He was an alien
of servile birth, and he had made himself wealthy by the
usual method of thinking of nothing but gold. These men,
who were not even free Romans, had mastered the power
which commands the allegiance of the world. The rise of
this new class to wealth and importance probably irritated
men of Juvenal’s type more than any other sign of social
injustice in their time. And the Trimalchio of Petronius, a
man of low, tainted origin, the creature of economic accident,
whose one faith is in the power of money, who boasts of his
fortune as if it had been won by real talent or honourable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg99" id="Pg99" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>service, who expends it with coarse ostentation and a ludicrous
affectation of cultivated taste, may be tolerated in literature,
if not in actual life, for the charm of a certain kindly bonhomie
and honest vulgarity, which the art of Petronius has
thrown around him. Yet, after all, we must concede to
Juvenal and Martial, that such a person is always a somewhat
unpleasing social product. But the subject is so important
that it claims a chapter to itself. And, fortunately
for us and our readers, the new freedmen were not all of the
type of Trimalchio.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The historian, who is occupied with war and politics, and the
fate of princes and nobles, is apt to lose sight of great silent
movements in the dim masses of society. And, in the history
of the early Empire, the deadly conflict between the Emperor
and the Senate, the carnival of luxury, and the tragic close of
so many reigns, have diverted attention from social changes of
immense moment. Not the least important of these was the
rise of the freedmen, in the face of the most violent prejudice,
both popular and aristocratic. And literature has thrown
its whole weight on the side of prejudice, and given full vent
alike to the scorn of the noble, and to the hate and envy of the
plebeian. The movement, indeed, was so swift and far spreading
that old conservative instincts might well be alarmed.
Everywhere in the inscriptions freedmen are seen rising to
wealth and consequence throughout the provinces, as well
as in Italy, and winning popularity and influence by profuse
benefactions to colleges and municipalities. In almost every
district of the Roman Empire the order of the Augustales,
which was composed to a great extent of wealthy freedmen,<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a>
has left its memorials. <span class="tei tei-q">“Freedman’s wealth”</span> in Martial’s day
had become a proverb.<a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a> Not only are they crowding all the
meaner trades, from which Roman pride shrank contemptuously,
but, by industry, shrewdness, and speculative daring,
they are becoming great capitalists and landowners on a
senatorial scale. The Trimalchio of Petronius, who has not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even seen some of his estates,<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a> if we allow for some artistic
exaggeration, is undoubtedly the representative of a great
class. In the reign of Nero, a debate arose in the Senate
on the insolence and misconduct of freedmen.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a> And it was
argued by those opposed to any violent measures of repression,
that the class was widely diffused; they were found in overwhelming
numbers in the city tribes, in the lower offices
of the civil service, in the establishments of the magistrates
and priests; a considerable number even of the knights and
Senate drew their origin from this source. If freedmen were
marked off sharply as a separate grade, the scanty numbers
of the freeborn would be revealed. In the reigns of Claudius
and Nero especially, freedmen rose to the highest places in
the imperial service, sometimes by unquestionable knowledge,
tact, and ability, sometimes by less creditable arts. The
promotion of a Narcissus or a Pallas was also a stroke of
policy, the assertion of the prince’s independence of a jealous
nobility. The rule of the freedmen was a bitter memory
to the Senate.<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a> The scorn of Pliny for Pallas expresses
the long pent-up feelings of his order; it is a belated
vengeance for the humiliation they endured in the evil days
when they heaped ridiculous flattery on the favourite, and
voted him a fortune and a statue.<a id="noteref_613" name="noteref_613" href="#note_613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">613</span></span></a> Some part of the joy
with which the accession of Trajan was hailed by the aristocracy
was due to the hope that the despised interlopers would
be relegated to their proper obscurity. Tacitus is undoubtedly
glancing at the Claudian régime when he grimly congratulates
the Germans on the fact that their freedmen are little above
the level of slaves, that they have seldom any power in the
family, and never in the State.<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href="#note_614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a>

It shows the immense force of old Roman conservatism
and of social prejudice which is the same from age to age,

Martial<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a> and Petronius, denounce or ridicule an irresistible
social movement. We can now see that the rise of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>emancipated slave was not only inevitable, but that it was, on
the whole, salutary and rich in promise for the future. The
slave class of antiquity really corresponded to our free labouring
class. But, unlike the mass of our artisans, it contained many
who, from accident of birth and education, had a skill and
knowledge which their masters often did not possess.<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href="#note_616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a> The

frequent mental and moral equality of the Roman slave with
his master had forced itself upon men of the detached
philosophic class, like Seneca, and on kindly aristocrats, like
Pliny.<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a> It must have been hard to sit long hours in the
library beside a cultivated slave-amanuensis, or to discuss the
management of lands and mines and quarries with a shrewd,
well-informed slave-agent, or to be charmed by the grace and
wit of some fair, frail daughter of Ionia, without having some
doubts raised as to the eternal justice of such an institution.
Nay, it is certain that slaves were often treated as friends,<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href="#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a>
and received freedom and a liberal bequest at their master’s
death. Many educated slaves, as we have seen, rose to
distinction and fortune as teachers and physicians.<a id="noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href="#note_619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a> But the
field of trade and industry was the most open and the most
tempting. The Senator was forbidden, down to the last age of
the Empire, both by law and sentiment, to increase his fortune
by commerce.<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a> The plebeian, saturated with Roman prejudice,
looking for support to the granaries of the state or the dole
of the wealthy patron, turned with disdain from occupations
which are in our days thought innocent, if not honourable.
Juvenal feels almost as much scorn for the auctioneer and
undertaker as he has for the pander, and treats almost as a
criminal the merchant who braves the wintry Aegean with a
cargo of wine from Crete.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href="#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> His friend Umbricius, worsted in
the social struggle, and preparing to quit Rome for a retreat in
Campania, among the other objects of his plebeian scorn, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>specially disgusted with the low tribe who contract for the
building of a house, or who farm the dues of a port or undertake
to cleanse a river-bed.<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> There is no room left in Rome
for men who will not soil themselves with such sordid trades.
Manifestly, if the satirist is not burlesquing the feeling of his
class, there was plenty of room left for the vigorous freedman
who could accept Vespasian’s motto that no gain is unsavoury.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href="#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a>
But those men had not only commercial tact and ability, the
wit to see where money was to be made by seizing new openings
and unoccupied fields for enterprise; they had also among
them men of great ambitions, men capable of great affairs. It
required no common deftness, suppleness, and vigilant energy
for an old slave to work his way upwards through the grades
of the imperial chancery, to thread the maze of deadly intrigue,
in the reigns of Claudius or Nero, and to emerge at last as
master of the palace. Yet one of these freedmen ministers,
when he died, had served ten emperors, six of whom had
come to a violent end.<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href="#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> That a class so despised and depressed
should rise to control the trade, and even the administration
of the Empire, furnishes a presumption that they were needed,
and that they were not unworthy of their destiny.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet however inevitable, or even desirable, this great revolution
may seem to the cool critic of the twentieth century, it is
possible that, had he lived in the first, he might have denounced
it as vigorously as Juvenal. The literary and artistic spirit,
often living in a past golden age, and remotely detached from
the movements going on around it, is prone to regard them
with uneasy suspicion. It is moved by sacred sentiment, by
memories and distant ideals, by fastidious taste, which expresses
itself often with passionate hatred for what seems to it
revolutionary sacrilege. It is also apt to fasten on the more
grotesque and vulgar traits of any great popular movement,
and to use a finished skill in making it ridiculous. It was in
this way that literature treated the freedmen. They had many
gross and palpable faults; they were old slaves and Orientals;
as they rose in the world they were eager for money, and
they got it; they were, many of them, naturally vulgar, and
they paraded their new wealth with execrable taste, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trampled on better, though poorer, men than themselves,
Juvenal and Martial, by birth and associations, have little in
common with that accomplished exquisite of the Neronian
circle who has painted with the power of careless genius the
household of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span> Trimalchio. Yet they have an
equal scorn or detestation for the new man who was forcing
his way from the lowest debasement of servile life to fortune
and power. But the embittered man of letters, humiliated by
poverty, yet brimful of Roman pride, avenges his ideals with
a rougher, heavier hand than the Epicurean noble, who had
joined in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Noctes Neronis”</span> with a delicate, scornful
cynicism, who was too disillusioned, and too fastidiously contemptuous,
to waste anger on what he despised. Juvenal
would blast and wither the objects of his hatred. Petronius
takes the surer method of making these people supremely
ridiculous. The feeling of men like Juvenal and Martial is
a mixture of contempt and envy and outraged taste. The
Grub Street man of letters in those days despised plodding
industry because he dearly loved fits of idleness; he hated
wealth because he was poor. The polished man of the world
was alternately amused and disgusted by the spectacle of
sudden fortune accumulated by happy chance or unscrupulous
arts, with no tradition of dignity to gild its grossness, yet
affecting and burlesquing the tastes of a world from which it
was separated by an impassable gulf. There is more moral
sentiment, more old Roman feeling, in the declamation of
Juvenal than in the cold artistic scorn of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span>; there
is also more personal and class feeling. The triumph of mere
money is to Juvenal a personal affront as well as a moral
catastrophe. Poverty now makes a man ridiculous.<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a> It blocks
the path of the finest merit. The rich freedman who claims
the foremost place at a levée is equally objectionable because
he was born on the Euphrates, and because he is the owner
of five taverns which yield HS.400,000 a year.<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> The impoverished

It is evident from Juvenal, Martial, and Petronius that
the popular hostility to the new men was partly the result of
envy at their success, partly of disgust at their parade of it.
Juvenal and Martial are often probably dressing up the rough
epigrams of the crowd. We can almost hear the contemptuous
growl as one of these people, suspected of a dark crime,
sweeps by in his downy sedan. That other noble knight used
to hawk the cheap fish of his native Egypt, and now possesses
a palace towering over the Forum, with far-spreading colonnades
and acres of shady groves.<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a> A eunuch minister has reared a

have invented some of the tales of crime and turpitude by
which these fortunes had been won. Rome was a city of
poisonous rumour. Yet slavery was not a nursery of virtue,
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> leaves the impression that the emancipated
slave too often imitated the vices of his master. The poisoner,
the perjurer, the minion, were probably to be found in the
rising class. After their kind in all ages, they looked down
with vulgar insolence on those less fortunate or more scrupulous.
When they rose to the highest place, the imperial freedmen
were often involved in peculation and criminal intrigue.<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href="#note_632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a> Yet,
after all reservations, the ascent of the freedmen remains a
great and beneficent revolution. The very reasons which made
Juvenal hate it most are its best justification to a modern
mind. It gave hope of a future to the slave; by creating
a free industrial class, it helped to break down the cramped
social ideal of the slave-owner and the soldier; it planted in
every municipality a vigorous mercantile class, who were
often excellent and generous citizens. Above all, it asserted
the dignity of man. The vehement iteration of Juvenal is the
best testimony to the sweep and force of the movement. And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the later student of Roman society cannot afford to neglect a
great social upheaval which, in an aristocratic society, dominated
by pride of class and race, made an Oriental slave first
minister of the greatest monarchy in history, while it placed
men of servile origin in command of nearly all the industrial
arts and commerce of the time.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reign of the freedman in public affairs began with the
foundation of the Empire, when Julius Caesar installed some of
his household as officers of the mint.<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a> The emperor in the
first century was, theoretically at least, only the first citizen, and
his household was modelled on the fashion of other great
houses. In the management of those vast senatorial
estates, which were often scattered over three continents, there
was need of an elaborate organisation, and freedmen of education
and business capacity were employed to administer such
private realms. And in the organisation of a great household,
there was a hierarchy of office which offered a career to
the shrewd and trustworthy slave. Many such careers can
be traced in the inscriptions, from the post of valet or groom
of the bedchamber, through the offices of master of the jewels
and the wardrobe, superintendent of the carriages or the vineyards,
up to the highest financial control.<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the first century the same system was transferred
to the imperial administration. It suited the cautious
policy of Augustus to disguise his vast powers under the quiet
exterior of an ordinary noble; and the freedmen of his
household carried on the business of the State. He sternly
punished any excesses or treachery among his servants.<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href="#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a>
Tiberius gave them little power, until his character began to
deteriorate.<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a> Under Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, the imperial
freedmen attained their greatest ascendency. Callistus,
Narcissus, and Pallas rose to the rank of great ministers, and,
in the reign of Claudius, were practically masters of the world.
They accumulated enormous wealth by abusing their power,
and making a traffic in civic rights, in places or pardons.
Polyclitus, who was sent to compose the troubles in Britain
in 61 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, travelled with an enormous train, and gave the
provinces an exhibition of the arrogance of their servile masters.<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href="#note_637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">637</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is curious that it was left for Vitellius to break the
reign of the freedmen by assigning offices in the imperial
bureaux to the knights, the policy which was said to have
been recommended by Maecenas,<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href="#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> and which was destined to
prevail in the second century. But the change was very
incomplete, and the brief tragic reign of Vitellius was disgraced
by the ascendency for a time of his minion Asiaticus,
whom the Emperor raised to the highest honours, then sold
into a troop of wandering gladiators, and finally received back
again into freedom and favour.<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a> The policy of the Flavian
dynasty in the employment of freedmen is rather ambiguous.
Vespasian is charged with having elevated Hormus, a disreputable
member of the class, and with having appointed
to places of trust the most rapacious agents.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> But this is
probably a calumny of the Neronian and Othonian circle who
defamed their conqueror. Under Domitian, the freedmen,
Entellus and Abascantus, held two of the great secretaryships.
But it is distinctly recorded that Domitian distributed offices
impartially between the freedmen and the knights.<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> On the

have procured his selection as emperor by carefully cultivating
the favour of Trajan’s freedmen. Hadrian, in reorganising
the imperial administration, and founding the bureaucratic
system, which was finally elaborated by Diocletian and Constantine,
practically confined the tenure of the three great
secretaryships to men of equestrian rank. Among his secretaries
was the historian Suetonius.<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href="#note_645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a> Antoninus Pius severely

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The position of freedmen in the imperial administration
was partly, as we have seen, a tradition of aristocratic households.
The emperor employed his freedmen to write his
despatches and administer the finances of the Empire, as
he would have used them to write his private letters or to
manage his private estates. But, in the long conflict between
the prince and the Senate, the employment of trusted freedmen
in imperial affairs was also a measure of policy. It was meant
to teach the nobles that the Empire could be administered
without their aid.<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a> Nor was the confidence of the Emperor
in his humble subordinates unjustified. The eulogies of the
great freedmen in Seneca and Statius, even if they be exaggerated,
leave the impression that a Polybius, a Claudius
Etruscus, or an Abascantus were, in many respects, worthy of
their high place. The provinces were, on the whole, well
governed and happy in the very years when the capital was
seething with conspiracy, and racked with the horrors of confiscation
and massacre. This must have been chiefly due to
the knowledge, tact, and ability of the great officials of the
palace. Although of servile origin, they must have belonged
to that considerable class of educated slaves who, along with
the versatility and tact of the Hellenic East, brought to their
task also a knowledge and a literary and linguistic skill which
were not common among Roman knights. The three imperial
secretaryships, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a rationibus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a libellis</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ab epistulis</span></span>, covered
a vast field of administration, and the duties of these great
ministries could only have been performed by men of great
industry, talent, and diplomatic adroitness.<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href="#note_648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a> The Polybius
to whom Seneca, from his exile in Sardinia, wrote a consolatory
letter on the death of his brother, was the successor
of Callistus, as secretary of petitions, in the reign of Claudius,
and also the emperor’s adviser of studies. Seneca magnifies
the dignity, and also the burden, of his great rank, which
demands an abnegation of all the ordinary pleasures of life.<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a>

could find time for literary work, and his translations from the
Greek are lauded by the philosopher with an enthusiasm of
which the cruelty of time does not allow us to estimate the
value.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a> The panegyric on Claudius Etruscus, composed by

of whom had died by a violent death. It was a strangely
romantic life, to which we could hardly find a parallel in
the most democratic community in modern times. Claudius,
a Smyrniote slave,<a id="noteref_653" name="noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> in the household of Tiberius, was emancipated
and promoted by that Emperor. He followed the
train of Caligula to Gaul,<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href="#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> rose to higher rank under Claudius,
and, probably in Nero’s reign, on the retirement of Pallas,
was appointed to that financial office of which the world-wide
cares are pompously described by the poet biographer.<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655" href="#note_655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">655</span></span></a> The
gold of Iberian mines, the harvests of Egypt, the fleeces of
Tarentine flocks, pearls from the depths of Eastern seas, the
ivory tribute of the Indies, all the wealth wafted to Rome by
every wind, are committed to his keeping. He had also the task
of disbursing a vast revenue for the support of the populace,
for roads and bulwarks against the sea, for the splendour of
temples and palaces.<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href="#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> Such cares left space only for brief
slumber and hasty meals; there was none for pleasure. Yet
Claudius had the supreme satisfaction of wielding enormous
power, and he occasionally shared in its splendour. The poor
slave from the Hermus had a place in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Idumaean
triumph”</span> of Vespasian, which his quiet labours had prepared,
and he was raised by that emperor to the benches of the
knights.<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href="#note_657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a> The only check in that prosperous course seems to

Danube, and the Rhine; he had to watch the distribution of
military grades and commands. He must keep himself informed
of a thousand things affecting the fortunes of the
subject peoples. Yet this powerful minister retained his
native modesty with his growing fortune. His household was
distinguished by all the sobriety and frugality of an Apulian
or Sabine home.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a> He could be lavish, however, at the call of

Some of the great imperial freedmen were of less unexceptionable
character than Claudius Etruscus and Abascantus,
and had a more troubled career. Callistus, Narcissus, and
Pallas, were deeply involved in the intrigues and crimes
connected with the history of Messalina and Agrippina.
Callistus had a part in the murder of Caligula, and prolonged
his power in the following reign. Narcissus revealed the
shameless marriage of Messalina with Silius, and, forestalling
the vacillation of Claudius, had the imperial harlot ruthlessly
struck down as she lay grovelling in the gardens of Lucullus.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a>

than Messalina, and his long career of plunder was ended by

a not less infamous and tragic career.<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a> Of all the great freedmen,
probably none approached him in magnificent insolence.
When he was impeached along with Burrus, on a groundless
charge of treason, and when some of his freedmen were called
in evidence as his supposed accomplices, the old slave answered
that he had never degraded his voice by speaking in such
company.<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href="#note_671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a> Never, even in those days of self-abasement, did
the Senate sink so low as in its grovelling homage to the
servile minister. At a meeting of the august body in the
year 52, the consul designate made a proposal, which was
seconded by a Scipio, that the praetorian insignia, and a sum
of HS.15,000,000, should be offered to Pallas, together with
the thanks of the state that the descendant of the ancient
kings of Arcadia had thought less of his illustrious race than
of the common weal, and had deigned to be enrolled in the
service of the prince!<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href="#note_672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a> When Claudius reported that his
minister was satisfied with the compliment, and prayed to be
allowed to remain in his former poverty, a senatorial decree,
engraved on bronze, was set up to commemorate the old-fashioned
frugality of the owner of HS.300,000,000! His
wealth was gained during a career of enormous power in the
worst days of the Empire. He was one of the lovers of
Agrippina,<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a> and, when he made her empress on the death of
Messalina, two kindred spirits for a time ruled the Roman
world. He gratified his patroness by securing the adoption
of Nero by Claudius, and he was probably an accomplice in
that emperor’s murder. But his fate was involved with that
of Agrippina. When Nero resolved to shake off the tyranny
of that awful woman, his first step was to remove the haughty
freedman from his offices.<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href="#note_674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a> Pallas left the palace in the
second year of Nero’s reign. For seven years he lived on undisturbed.
But at last his vast wealth, which had become a
proverb, became too tempting to the spendthrift prince, and
Pallas was quietly removed by poison.<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wealth of freedmen became proverbial, and the
fortunes of Pallas and Narcissus reached a figure hardly ever
surpassed even by the most colossal senatorial estates.<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a> The
means by which this wealth was gained might easily be inferred
by any one acquainted with the inner history of the times.
The manner of it may be read in the life of Elagabalus, whose
freedman Zoticus, the son of a cook at Smyrna, piled up vast
riches by levying a payment, each time he quitted the presence,
for his report of the emperor’s threats or promises or intentions.<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677" href="#note_677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">677</span></span></a>
In the administration of great provinces, in the distribution of
countless places of trust, in the chaos of years of delation,
confiscation, and massacre, there must have been endless opportunities
for self-enrichment, without incurring the dangers
of open malversation. Statius extols the simple tastes and
frugality of his heroes Abascantus and Claudius Etruscus, and
yet he describes them as lavishing money on baths and tombs
and funeral pomp. The truth is that, as a mere matter of
policy, these wealthy aliens, who were never loved by a jealous
aristocracy, had to justify their huge fortunes by a sumptuous
splendour. The elder Pliny has commemorated the vapour
baths of Posides, a Claudian freedman, and the thirty pillars
of priceless onyx which adorned the dining saloon of Callistus.<a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a>
A bijou bath of the younger Claudius Etruscus seems to have
been a miracle of costly beauty. The dome, through which a
brilliant light streamed upon the floor, was covered with scenes in
rich mosaic. The water gushed from pipes of silver into silver
basins, and the quarries of Numidia and Synnada contributed
the various colours of their marbles.<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href="#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a> The gardens of Entellus,
with their purple clusters which defied the rigours of winter,
seemed to Martial to outrival the legendary gardens of Phaeacia.<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a>
In the suburbs, hard by the Tiburtine way, rose that defiant
monument of Pallas, bearing the decree of the Senate, which
aroused the angry scorn of the younger Pliny.<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href="#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a>

The life of one of these imperial slave ministers was a
strangely romantic career which has surely been seldom
matched in the history of human fortunes. Exposed and sold
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in early youth in the slave markets of Smyrna, Delos, or
Puteoli, after an interval of ignominious servitude, installed
as groom of the chambers, thence promoted, according to his
aptitudes, to be keeper of the jewels, or tutor of the imperial
heir, still further advanced to be director of the post, or to a
place in the financial service, the freedman might end by
receiving the honour of knighthood, the procuratorship of a
province, or one of those great ministries which placed him in
command of the Roman world. Yet we must not deceive ourselves
as to his real position.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a> To the very end of the Empire,
the fictions on which aristocratic power is largely based,
retained their fascination. In the fifth century a Senate, whose
ancestors were often originally of servile race, could pour their
scorn on the eunuch ministers of the East.<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a> And the decaying
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span> Senate of the Flavians had, when they were free
to express it, nothing but loathing for the reign of the freedmen.<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a>
These powerful but low-born officials are a curious
example of what has been often seen in later times, the
point-blank refusal, or the grudging concession, of social
status to men wielding vast and substantial power. The
younger Pliny, in his Panegyric on Trajan, glories in the
preference shown under the new régime for young men of
birth, and in his letters he vents all the long-suppressed
scorn of his order for the Claudian freedmen. Even the
emperors who freely employed their services, were chary of
raising them to high social rank. Freedmen ministers were
hardly ever admitted to the ranks of the Senate<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href="#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a>; they were
rarely present at its sittings, even at the very time when they
were governing the world. Sacerdotal and military distinctions
were seldom conferred upon any of them. They were
sometimes invested with the insignia of praetorian or quaestorian
rank.<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> A few were promoted to the dignity of knighthood,
Icelus, Asiaticus, Hormus, and Claudius Etruscus<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a>; but many
a passage in Martial or Juvenal seems to show that ordinary
equestrian rank was in those days a very doubtful distinction.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a>
The emperors, as raised above all ranks, might not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have been personally unwilling to elevate their creatures to
the highest social grade.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> But even the emperors, in matters
of social prejudice, were not omnipotent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still, the men who could win the favours of an Agrippina
and a Messalina, could not be extinguished by the most jealous
social prejudice. The Roman Senate were ready, on occasion,
to fawn on a Pallas or a Narcissus, to vote them money and
insignia of rank, nor did they always refuse them their
daughters in marriage. In the conflict which is so often seen
between caste pride and the effective power of new wealth,
the wealth and power not unfrequently prevail. The lex
Julia prohibited the union of freedmen with daughters of a
senatorial house.<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href="#note_690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> Yet we know of several such marriages
in the first century. The wife of the freedman Claudius
Etruscus, was the sister of a consul who had held high
command against the Dacians.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> Priscilla, the wife of
Abascantus, another minister of servile origin, belonged to
the great consular family of the Antistii. Felix, the brother
of Pallas, had married in succession three ladies of royal blood,
one of them the granddaughter of Cleopatra.<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The women of this class, for generations, wielded, in their
own way, a power which sometimes rivalled that of the
men. These plebeian Aspasias are a puzzling class. With
no recognised social position, with the double taint of servile
origin and more than doubtful morals, they were often
endowed with many charms and accomplishments, possessing
a special attraction for bohemian men of letters. Their
morals were the result of an uncertain social position, combined
with personal attractions and education. To be
excluded from good society by ignoble birth, yet to be more
than its equal in culture, is a dangerous position, especially for
women. Often of oriental extraction, these women were the
most prominent votaries of the cults or superstitions which
poured into Rome from the prolific East. Loose character
and religious fervour were easily combined in antiquity. And
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demi-monde</span></span> of those days were ready to mourn passionately
for Adonis and keep all the feasts of Isis or Jehovah, without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scrupling to make a temple a place of assignation.<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693" href="#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> The
history of the early Empire, it has been rather inaccurately
said, shows no reign of mistresses. Yet some of the freedwomen
have left their mark on that dark page of history.
Claudius was the slave of women, and two of his mistresses
lent their aid to Narcissus to compass the ruin of Messalina.<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a>
The one woman whom Nero really loved, and who loved him
in return, was Acte, who had been bought in a slave market
in Asia. She captured the heart of the Emperor in his early
youth, and incurred the fierce jealousy of Agrippina, as she
did, at a later date, that of the fair, ambitious Poppaea.<a id="noteref_695" name="noteref_695" href="#note_695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a>
Acte was faithful to his memory even after the last awful
scene in Phaon’s gardens.<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href="#note_696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a> And, along with his two nurses,
the despised freedwoman guarded his remains and laid the
last of his line beside his ancestors. Caenis, the mistress
who consoled Vespasian after his wife’s death, without
any attractions of youth or beauty, suited well the taste of
the bourgeois Emperor. It was a rather sordid and prosaic
union. And Caenis is said to have accumulated a fortune,
and besmirched the honest Emperor’s name, by a wholesale
traffic in State secrets and appointments.<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a> In the last years
of our period a very different figure has been glorified by
the art of Lucian. Panthea, the mistress of L. Verus, completely
fascinated the imagination of Lucian when he saw
her at Smyrna, during the visit of her lover to the East.<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a>
Lucian pictures her delicately chiselled beauty and grace of
form by recalling the finest traits in the great masterpieces
of Pheidias and Praxiteles and Calamis, of Euphranor and
Polygnotus and Apelles; Panthea combines them all. She
has a voice of a marvellous and mellow sweetness, which lingers
in the ear with a haunting memory. And the soul was worthy
of such a fair dwelling-place. In her love of music and
poetry, combined with a masculine strength of intellect capable
of handling the highest problems in politics or dialectic, she
was a worthy successor of those elder daughters of Ionia whose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>charm and strength drew a Socrates or a Pericles to their feet.<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href="#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a>
Surrounded by luxury and the pomp of imperial rank, and
linked to a very unworthy lover, Panthea never lost her
natural modesty and simple sweetness.

The great freedmen, who held the highest offices in the
imperial service till the time of Hadrian with almost undisputed
sway, are interesting by reason of the strangely romantic
career of some of them. But these are very exceptional
cases. In the bureaux of finance, it has been discovered from
the inscriptions that the officials were all of equestrian rank.
On the other hand, a great number of the provincial procurators
were freedmen. And the agents of the Emperor’s
private fisc seem to have been nearly always drawn from
this class. The lower grades of the civil service were full
of them.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a> But to the student of society, the official freedmen
are, as a class, not so interesting as their brethren who in
these same years were making themselves masters of the trade
and commercial capital of the Roman world. And the
interest is heightened by the vivid art with which Petronius
has ushered us into the very heart of this rather vulgar
society. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> is to some extent a caricature. There
were hosts of modest, estimable freedmen whose only record is
in two or three lines on a funeral slab. Yet a caricature must
have a foundation of truth, and a careful reader may discover
the truth under the humorous exaggeration of Petronius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The transition from the status of slave to that of freedman
was perhaps not so abrupt and marked as we might at first
sight suppose. It is probable that many a slave of the better
and more intelligent class found little practical change in the
tenor of his life when he received the touch of the wand
before the praetor. Some, like Melissus, the free-born slave
of Maecenas, actually rejected the proffered boon.<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> There
was, of course, much cruelty to slaves in many Roman households,
and the absolute power of a master, unrestrained by
principle or kindly feeling, was an unmitigated curse till it
was limited by the humane legislation of the second century.<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a>
But there must have been many houses, like that of the
younger Pliny, where the slaves were treated, in Seneca’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>phrase, as humble friends and real members of the family,
where their marriages were fêted with general gaiety,<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a> where
their sicknesses were tenderly watched, and where they were
truly mourned in death. The inscriptions reveal to us a
better side of slave life, which is not so prominent in our
literary authorities. There is many an inscription recording
the love and faithfulness of the slave husband and wife,
although not under those honoured names. And it is
significant that on many of these tablets the honourable
title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">conjunx</span></span> is taking the place of the old servile <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contubernalis</span></span>.
The inscriptions which testify to the mutual love
of master and servant are hardly less numerous. In one a
master speaks of a slave-child of four years as being dear to
him as a son.<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> Another contains the memorial of a learned
lady erected by her slave librarian.<a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href="#note_705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">705</span></span></a> Another records the
love of a young noble for his nurse,<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> while another is the
pathetic tribute of the nurse to her young charge, who died
at five years of age. The whole city household of another
great family subscribe from their humble savings for an
affectionate memorial of their young mistress.<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> Seneca, in
his humanitarian tone about slavery, represents a great
moral movement, which was destined to express itself in
legislation under the Antonines. And the energy with which
Seneca denounced harsh or contemptuous conduct to these
humble dependents had evidently behind it the force of a
steadily growing sentiment. The master who abused his
power was already beginning to be a marked man.<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a>

Frequent manumissions were swelling the freedman class
to enormous dimensions. The emancipation of slaves by
dying bequest was not then, indeed, inspired by the same
religious motive as in the Middle Ages. But it was often
dictated by the natural, human wish to make some return to
faithful servants, and to leave a memory of kindness behind.
But without the voluntary generosity of the master, the slave
could easily purchase his own freedom. The price of slaves
varied enormously, according to their special aptitude and grade
of service. It might range from £1700, in rare cases, to £10,
or even less, in our money.<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> But taking the average price of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ordinary slaves, one careful and frugal might sometimes save
the cost of his freedom in a few years. The slave, especially if he
had any special gift, or if he occupied a prominent position in
the household, had many chances of adding to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span>.
But the commonest drudge might spare something from the
daily allowance of food.<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> Others, like the cooks in Apuleius,

The door-keepers, a class notorious for their insolence in
Martial’s day,<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> often levied heavy tolls for admission to their
master’s presence. And good-natured visitors would not
depart without leaving a gift to those who had done
them service. It must also be remembered that the slave
system of antiquity covered much of the ground of our
modern industrial organisation. A great household, or a
great estate, was a society almost complete in itself. And
intelligent slaves were often entrusted with the entire management
of certain departments.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a> The great rural properties had
their quarries, brickworks, and mines; and manufactures of all
kinds were carried on by servile industry, with slaves or
freedmen as managers. The merchant, the banker, the
contractor, the publisher, had to use, not only slave labour,
but slave skill and superintendence.<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> The great household
needed to be organised under chiefs. And on rural estates,
down to the end of the Western Empire, the villicus or
procurator was nearly always a man of servile origin.<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> In
these various capacities, the trusted slave was often practically
a partner, with a share of the profits, or he had a
commission on the returns. Such a fortunate servant, by
hoarding his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span>, might soon become a capitalist on his
own account, and well able, if he chose, to purchase his
freedom. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span>, like that of the son <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in manu patris</span></span>,
was of course by law the property of his master. But the
security of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span> was the security for good service.<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>
Thus a useful and favourite slave often easily became a
freedman, sometimes by purchase, or, as often happened in
the case of servants of the imperial house, by the free gift of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the lord. There are even cases on record where a slave was
left heir of his master’s property. Trimalchio boasted that he
had been made by his master joint heir with the Emperor.<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The tie between patron and freedman was very close. The
emancipated slave had often been a trusted favourite, and even
a friend of the family, and his lord was under an obligation
to provide for his future. The freedman frequently remained
in the household, with probably little real change in his position.
His patron owed him at least support and shelter. But he
often gave him, besides, the means of an independent life,
a farm, a shop, or capital to start in some trade.<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> In the
time of Ovid, a freedman of M. Aurelius Cotta had more than
once received from his patron the fortune of a knight, besides
ample provision for his children.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a> A similar act of generosity,
which was recklessly abused, is recorded by Martial.<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a> By
ancient law, as well as by sentiment, senators were forbidden
to soil themselves by trade or usury.<a id="noteref_721" name="noteref_721" href="#note_721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">721</span></span></a> But so inconvenient a
prohibition was sure to be evaded. And probably the most
frequent means of evasion was by entrusting senatorial capital
to freedmen or clients, or even to the higher class of slaves.<a id="noteref_722" name="noteref_722" href="#note_722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">722</span></span></a>
When Trimalchio began to rise in the social scale, he gave up
trade, and employed his capital in financing men of the freedman
class.<a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href="#note_723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">723</span></span></a> These people, generally of Levantine origin, had the
aptitude for commerce which has at all times been a characteristic
of their race. And, in the time of the Empire, almost all
trade and industry was in their hands. The tale of Petronius
reveals the secret of their success. They value money beyond
anything else; it is the one object of their lives. They frankly
estimate a man’s worth and character in terms of cash.<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> Keen,

They are entirely of Vespasian’s opinion that gold from any
quarter, however unsavoury, <span class="tei tei-q">“never smells.”</span> Taking the world
as it was, in many respects they deserved to succeed. They
were not, indeed, encumbered with dignity or self-respect. They
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had one goal, and they worked towards it with infinite industry
and unfailing courage and self-confidence. Nothing daunts or
dismays them. If a fleet of merchantmen, worth a large fortune,
is lost in a storm, the freedman speculator will at once sell his
wife’s clothes and jewels, and start cheerfully on a fresh venture.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a>
When his great ambition has been achieved, he enjoys its fruits
after his kind in all ages. Excluded from the great world of
hereditary culture, these people caricature its tastes, and imitate
all its vices, without catching even a reflection of its charm
and refinement. The selfish egotism of the dissipated noble
might be bad enough, but it was sometimes veiled by a careless
grace, or an occasional deference to lofty tradition. The selfishness
and grossness of the upstart is naked and not ashamed,
or we might almost say, it glories in its shame. Its luxury is
a tasteless attempt to vie with the splendour of aristocratic
banquets. The carver and the waiter perform their tasks to
the beat of a deafening music. Art and literature are prostituted
to the service of this vulgar parade of new wealth, and the
divine Homer is profaned by a man who thinks that Hannibal
fought in the Trojan War.<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a> The conversation is of the true
bourgeois tone, with all its emphasis on the obvious, its unctuous
moralising, its platitudes consecrated by their antiquity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is this society which is drawn for us with such a sure,
masterly hand, and with such graceful ease, by Petronius.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> is well known to be one of the great puzzles and
mysteries in Roman literature. Scholars have held the most
widely different opinions as to its date, its author, and its purpose.
The scene has been laid in the reign of Augustus or of
Tiberius, and, on the strength of a misinterpreted inscription,
even as late as the reign of Alexander Severus.<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> Those who
have attributed it to the friend and victim of Nero have been
confronted with the silence of Quintilian, Juvenal, and Martial,
with the silence of Tacitus as to any literary work by
Petronius, whose character and end he has described with a
curious sympathy and care.<a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> It is only late critics of the
lower empire, such as Macrobius,<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> and a dilettante aristocrat
like Sidonius Apollinaris,<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> who pay any attention to this
    re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>markable work of genius. And Sidonius seems to make its
author a citizen of Marseilles.<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> Yet silence in such cases may
be very deceptive. Martial and Statius never mention one
another, and both might seem unknown to Tacitus. And
Tacitus, after the fashion of the Roman aristocrat, in painting
the character of Petronius, may not have thought it relevant or
important to notice a light work such as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span>, even
if he had ever seen it. He does not think it worth while to
mention the histories of the Emperor Claudius, the tragedies of
Seneca, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Punica</span></span> of Silius Italicus.<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a> Tacitus, like Thucydides,
is too much absorbed in the social tragedy of his time to
have any thought to spare for its artistic efforts. The rather
shallow, easy-going Pliny has told us far more of social life in
the reigns of Domitian and Trajan, its rural pleasures and its
futile literary ambitions, than the great, gloomy historian who was
absorbed in the vicissitudes of the deadly duel between the
Senate and the Emperors. One thing is certain about the author
of this famous piece—he was not a plebeian man about town,
although it may be doubted whether M. Boissier is safe in
maintaining that such a writer would not have chosen his own
environment of the Suburra as the field for his imagination.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a>
It is safer to seek for light on the social status of the author
in the tone of his work. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> is emphatically the
production of a cultivated aristocrat, who looks down with
serene and amused scorn on the vulgar bourgeois world which he
is painting. He is interested in it, but it is the interest of the
detached, artistic observer, whose own world is very far off.
Encolpius and Trimalchio and his coarse freedman friends are
people with whom the author would never have dined, but
whom, at a safe social distance, he found infinitely amusing as
well as disgusting. He saw that a great social revolution
was going on before his eyes, that the old slave minion, with
estates in three continents, was becoming the rival of the great
noble in wealth, that the new-sprung class were presenting to
the world a vulgar caricature of the luxury in the palaces on
the Esquiline. Probably he thought it all bad,<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> but the bad
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>became worse when it was coarse and vulgar. The ignorant
assumption of literary and artistic taste in Trimalchio must
have been contrasted in the author’s mind with many an
evening at the palace, when Nero, in his better moods, would
recite his far from contemptible verses, or his favourite passages
from Euripides, and when the new style of Lucan would be
balanced against that of the great old masters.<a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> And the man
who had been charmed with the sprightly grace of the stately
and charming Poppaea may be forgiven for showing his
hard contempt for Fortunata, who, in the middle of dinner,
runs off to count the silver and deal out the slaves’ share of
the leavings, and returns to get drunk and fight with one of
her guests.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The motive of the work has been much debated. It has
been thought a satire on the Neronian circle, and again an
effort to gratify it, by a revelation of the corruptions of the
plebeian world, the same impulse which drove Messalina to the
brothel, and Nero to range the taverns at midnight.<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href="#note_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> It has
been thought a satire on the insolence and grossness of Pallas
and the freedmen of the Claudian régime which Nero detested,
to amuse him with all their vulgar absurdities. Is it not
possible that the writer was merely pleasing himself—that he
was simply following the impulse of genius? Since the
seventh century the work has only existed in fragments.<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> Who
can tell how much the lost portions, if we possessed them,
might affect our judgment of the object of the work? One
thing is certain, its author was a very complex character, and
would probably have smiled at some of the lumbering efforts
to read his secret. Even though he may have had no lofty
purpose, a weary man of pleasure may have wished to display,
in its grossest, vulgarest form, the life of which he had tasted the
pleasures, and which he had seen turning into Dead Sea fruit.
He was probably a bad man in his conduct, worse perhaps in
his imagination; and yet, by a strange contradiction, which is
not unexampled in the history of character, he may have had
dreams of a refined purity and temperance which tortured and
embittered him by their contrast with actual life.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Out of the smoke of controversy, the conclusion seems
to have emerged that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> is a work of Nero’s reign,
and that its author was in all probability that Caius Petronius
who was Nero’s close companion, and who fell a victim to the
jealousy of Tigellinus. Not the least cogent proof of this is the
literary criticism of the work. It is well known that Lucan,
belonging to the Spanish family of the Senecas, had thrown
off many of the conventions of Roman literature, and
discarded the machinery of epic mythology in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharsalia</span></span>.
He had also incurred the literary jealousy of Nero. The
attack in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> on Lucan’s literary aberrations can
hardly be mistaken. The old poet Eumolpus is introduced to
defend the traditions of the past. And he gives a not very
successful demonstration, in 285 verses, of the manner in which
the subject should have been treated, with all the scenery and
machinery of orthodox epic.<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> This specimen of conservative
taste is the least happy part of the work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such evidence is reinforced by the harmony of the whole
tone of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> with the clear-cut character of Petronius
in Tacitus. There was evidently a singular fascination about
this man, which, in spite of his wasted, self-indulgent life,
was keenly felt by the severe historian. Petronius was
capable of great things, but in an age of wild licence he
deliberately devoted his brilliant talent to making sensuality
a fine art. Like Otho, who belonged to the same circle,
he showed, as consul and in the government of Bithynia,
that a man of pleasure could be equal to great affairs.<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> After
this single digression from the scheme of the voluptuary, he
returned to his pleasures, and became an arbiter in all questions
of sensual taste, from whose decision there was no appeal.
His ascendency over the Emperor drew upon him the fatal
enmity of Tigellinus. Petronius was doomed. It was a time
when not even the form of justice was used to veil the caprices
of tyranny, and Petronius determined not to endure a long
suspense when the issue was certain. He had gone as far as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Cumae to attend the Emperor. There he was stopped. He
retired to his chamber and had his veins alternately opened
and rebound, meanwhile conversing with his friends or listening
to light verses, not, as the fashion then was, seeking consolation
from a Stoic director on the issues of life and death. He
rewarded some of his slaves; others he had flogged before
his eyes. After a banquet he fell calmly into his last sleep
In his will there was none of the craven adulation by which
the victim often strove to save his heirs from imperial rapacity.
He broke his most precious myrrhine vase, to prevent its being
added to Nero’s treasures.<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> His only bequest to the Emperor
was a stinging catalogue of his secret and nameless sins.<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span>, as we have it, is only a fragment, containing
parts of two books, out of a total of sixteen. It is full of
humorous exaggeration and wild Aristophanic fun, along with,
here and there, very subtle and refined delineation of character.
But, except in the famous dinner of Trimalchio, there are few
signs of regular construction or closeness of texture in plot
and incident. Even if we had the whole, it might have been
difficult to decipher its motive or to unlock the secret of the
author’s character. We can only be sure that he was a man
of genius, and that he was interested in the intellectual pursuits
and tendencies of his time, as well as in its vices and
follies. We may perhaps surmise that he was at once perverted
and disillusioned, alternately fascinated and disgusted
by the worship of the flesh and its lusts in that evil time.
He is not, as has been sometimes said, utterly devoid of
a moral sense. Occasionally he shows a gleam of nobler
feeling, a sense of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lacrimae rerum</span></span>, as in that passage
where the corpse of the shipwrecked Lichas is washed
ashore. <span class="tei tei-q">“Somewhere a wife is quietly awaiting him, or
a father or a son, with no thought of storm; some one
whom he kissed on leaving.... He had examined the
accounts of his estates, he had pictured to himself the day of
his return to his home. And now he lies, O ye gods, how far
from the goal of his hopes. But the sea is not the only
mocker of the hopes of men. If you reckon well, there is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shipwreck everywhere.”</span><a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> There is also a curious note of contempt
for his own age in a passage on the decay of the fine
arts. The tone is, for the moment, almost that of Ruskin.
The glories of the golden age of art were the result of
simple virtue. An age like the Neronian, an age abandoned
to wine and harlotry, which dreams only of making money
by any sordid means, cannot even appreciate what the great
masters have left behind, much less itself produce anything
worthy. Even the gods of the Capitol are now honoured by
an offering of crude bullion, not by the masterpieces of a
Pheidias or an Apelles. And the race which created them
are now for us, forsooth, silly Greeklings!<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet side by side with a passage like this, there are descriptions
of abnormal depravity so coarsely realistic that it has
often been assumed, and not unnaturally, that the writer rioted
in mere filth. It should be remembered, however, that there
was a tradition of immorality about the ancient romance,<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> and
Petronius, had he cared to do so, might have made the same
apology as Martial, that he provided what his readers
demanded.<a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href="#note_747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">747</span></span></a> That Petronius was deeply tainted is only too
probable from his associations, although Tacitus implies that
he was rather a fastidious voluptuary than a gross debauchee.
Yet a sensualist of the intellectual range of Petronius may
have occasionally visions of a better world than that to which
he has sunk. Is it not possible that the gay elegant trifler
may sometimes have scorned himself as he scorned his time?
Is it not possible that, along with other illusions, he had
parted with the illusions of vice, and that in the <span class="tei tei-q">“noctes
Neronis”</span> he had seen the adder among the roses? He has
written one of the keenest satires ever penned on the vulgarity
of mere wealth, its absurd affectations, its vanity, its grossness.
May he not also have wished, without moralising in a fashion
which so cultivated a trifler would have scorned, to reveal the
abyss towards which a society lost to all the finer passions
of the spirit was hurrying? In the half comic, half ghastly
scene in which Trimalchio, in a fit of maudlin sentiment,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has himself laid out for dead, while the horns blare out his
funeral lament, we seem to hear the knell of a society which
was the slave of gold and gross pleasure, and seemed to be
rotting before its death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it need hardly be said that the prevailing note of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> is anything but melancholy. The author is intensely
amused with his subject, and the piece is full of the most
riotous fun and humour. It belongs formally to the medley
of prose and verse which Varro introduced into Roman
literature on the model of Menippus of Gadara.<a id="noteref_748" name="noteref_748" href="#note_748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a> It contains
disquisitions on literary tendencies of the day in poetry and
oratory, anecdotes and desultory talk. But Petronius has
given a new character to the old <span class="tei tei-q">“Satura,”</span> more in the
manner of the Greek romance. There probably was no regular
plot in the complete work, no central motive, such as the
wrath of Priapus,<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> to bind it together. Yet there is a certain
bond of union in the narrative of lively, and often questionable,
adventures through which Petronius carries his very disreputable
characters. In this life and movement, this human
interest, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Satiricon</span></span> is the distant ancestor of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gil Blas</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roderick Random</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tom Jones</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scene of the earlier part, long since lost, may have been
laid at Massilia.<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href="#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a> In the two books partially preserved to us, it

The three strangers, whose adventures are related,
Encolpius, Ascyltus, and Giton, if we may judge by their
names, are also Greek, with the literary culture of their time,
and deeply tainted with its worst vices. At the opening of
our fragment, Encolpius, a beggarly, wandering sophist, is
declaiming in a portico on the decay of oratory.<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href="#note_752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a> He is
expressing what was probably Petronius’s own judgment, as
it was that of Tacitus,<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> as to the evil effects of school
declamation on musty or frivolous subjects. He is met by a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rival lecturer, Agamemnon, who urges, on behalf of the
unfortunate teachers of this conventional rhetoric, that the
fault lies not with them, but with the parents and the public,
the same excuse, in fact, which Plato had long before made
for the maligned sophist of the fifth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span><a id="noteref_754" name="noteref_754" href="#note_754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">754</span></span></a> But
Encolpius and his companions, in spite of these literary
interests, are the most disreputable adventurers, educated
yet hopelessly depraved. They are even more at home
in the reeking slums than in the lecture hall. Encolpius has
been guilty of murder, theft, seduction. The party are
alternately plunderers and plundered. They riot for the
moment in foul excesses, and are tortured by jealousy and
the miseries of squalid vice. Only those who have a taste
for pornography will care to follow them in these dark paths.
Reduced to the last pinch of poverty, they are invited to dine
at the all-welcoming table of Trimalchio, and this is for us the
most interesting passage in their adventures. But, on leaving
the rich freedman’s halls they once more pass into scenes
where a modern pen cannot venture to follow them. Yet soon
afterwards, Encolpius is found in a picture gallery discussing
the fate of literature and art with Eumolpus,<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755" href="#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a> an inveterate
poet, as vicious as himself. Presently the party are on
shipboard off the south Italian coast. They are shipwrecked
and cast ashore in a storm near the town of Croton.<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756" href="#note_756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">756</span></span></a> A
friendly peasant informs them that, if they are honest
merchants, that is no place for their craft. But if they
belong to the more distinguished world of intrigue, they may
make their fortune. It is a society which has no care for
letters or virtue, which thinks only of unearned gain. There
are only two classes, the deceivers and their victims. Children
are an expensive luxury, for only the childless ever receive an
invitation or any social attention. It is like a city ravaged by
the plague; there are only left the corpses and the vultures.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href="#note_757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a>
The adventurers resolve to seize the rare opportunity; they
will turn the tables on the social birds of prey. The pauper
poet is easily translated into a millionaire with enormous
estates in Africa.<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a> A portion of his wealth has been engulfed

still remains. He has a cough, moreover, with other signs of
debility. There is no more idiotic person, as our Stock
Exchange records show, than a man eager for an unearned
fortune. The poor fools flocked around Eumolpus, drinking in
every fresh rumour about his will. He was loaded with gifts;<a id="noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href="#note_759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a>

follies or tortures their avidity. In one of his many wills, the
heirs of the pretended Croesus are required not to touch their
booty till they have devoured his remains before the people!<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href="#note_761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">761</span></span></a>
The tales of barbarian tribes in Herodotus, the memories of
the siege of Saguntum and Numantia, are invoked in brutal
irony to justify the reasonableness of the demand. <span class="tei tei-q">“Close
your eyes,”</span> the cynic enjoins, <span class="tei tei-q">“and fancy that instead of
devouring human flesh, you are swallowing a million of
money.”</span> Petronius could be very brutal as well as very
refined in his raillery. The combined stupidity and greed of
the fortune-hunter of all ages are perhaps best met by such
brutality of contempt.

The really interesting part of their adventure is the
dinner at the house of Trimalchio, a rich freedman, to which
these rascals were invited. Trimalchio is probably in many
traits drawn from life, but the picture of himself, of his
wife and his associates, is a work of genius worthy of Fielding
or Smollett or Le Sage. Petronius, it is clear, enjoyed his
work, and, in spite of his contempt for the vulgar ambition
and the coarseness and commonness of Trimalchio’s class, he
has a liking for a certain simplicity and honest good nature in
Trimalchio. The freedman tells the story of his own career<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href="#note_762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a>
without reserve, and with a certain pride in the virtue and
frugality, according to his standards, which have made him
what he is. He also exults in his shrewdness and business
capacity. His motto has always been, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are worth just
what you have.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Buy cheap and sell dear.”</span> Coming as a
little slave boy from Asia, probably in the reign of Augustus,<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href="#note_763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he became the favourite of his master, and more than the
favourite of his mistress. He found himself in the end the
real master of the household, and, on his patron’s death, he was
left joint-heir to his property with the emperor. But he had
ambitions beyond even such a fortune. He became a ship-owner
on a great scale. He lost a quarter of a million in a
single storm, and at once proceeded to build more and larger ships.
Money poured in; all his ventures prospered. He bought estates
in Italy, Sicily, and Africa. Some of his purchases he had never
seen.<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a> He built himself a stately house, with marble porticoes,
four great banqueting-halls, and twenty sleeping-rooms.<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a> Everything
to satisfy human wants was produced upon his lands. He
was a man of infinite enterprise. He had improved the breed
of his flocks by importing rams from Tarentum. He had bees

wife, who had been caught in adultery with the bathman; a
sum of HS.100,000 paid into the chest, and waiting for
investment—these are some of the items of news. Trimalchio, who
bears now, after the fashion of his class, the good Roman name
of Caius Pompeius, has risen to the dignity of Sevir Augustalis
in his municipality;<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href="#note_768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> he is one of the foremost persons in it,
with an overwhelming sense of the dignity of wealth, and with
a ridiculous affectation of artistic and literary culture, which he
parades with a delightful unconsciousness of his blunders.

When the wandering adventurers arrive for dinner,<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href="#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> they
find a bald old man in a red tunic playing at ball, with eunuchs
in attendance. While he is afterwards being rubbed down
with unguents in the bath, his servants refresh themselves
with old Falernian. Then, with four richly dressed runners
preceding him, and wrapped in a scarlet mantle, he is borne to
the house in his sedan along with his ugly minion. On the wall
of the vestibule, as you entered, there were frescoes, one of
which represented the young Trimalchio, under the leadership
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Minerva, making his entry into Rome, with other striking

flowing horn, and the Fates spin the golden thread of his
destiny.<a id="noteref_770" name="noteref_770" href="#note_770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">770</span></span></a> The banquet begins; Alexandrian boys bring iced

and the blare of instruments. To a great, deafening burst of
music, the host is at last borne in buried in cushions, his bare
shaven head protruding from a scarlet cloak, with a stole
around his neck, and lappets falling on each side; his hands
and arms loaded with rings.<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href="#note_772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a> Not being just then quite ready
for dinner, he, with a kindly apology, has a game of draughts,
until he feels inclined to eat, the pieces on the terebinthine
board being, appropriately to such a player, gold and silver
coins.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> The dinner is a long series of surprises, on the artistic
ingenuity of which Trimalchio plumes himself vastly. One
course represents the twelve signs of the Zodiac, of which
the host expounds at length the fateful significance.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a>
Another dish was a large boar, with baskets of sweetmeats
hanging from its tusks. A huge bearded hunter pierced its
sides with a hunting knife, and forthwith from the wound
there issued a flight of thrushes which were dexterously captured
in nets as they flew about the room.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href="#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a> Towards the end
of the meal the guests were startled by strange sounds in the
ceiling, and a quaking of the whole apartment. As they raised
their eyes, the ceiling suddenly opened, and a great circular
tray descended, with a figure of Priapus, bearing all sorts of
fruit and bon-bons.<a id="noteref_776" name="noteref_776" href="#note_776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a> It may be readily assumed that in
such a scene the wine was not stinted. Huge flagons, coated
with gypsum, were brought in shoulder high, each with a label
attesting that it was the great Falernian vintage of Opimius,
one hundred years old.<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href="#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a> As the wine appeared, the genial
host remarked with admirable frankness, <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not give as
good wine yesterday, although I had a more distinguished
company!”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The amusements of the banquet were as various, and some
of them as coarse or fantastic, as the dishes. They are gross
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and tasteless exaggerations of the prevailing fashion. In a
literary age, a man of Trimalchio’s position must affect some
knowledge of letters and art. He is a ludicrous example of
the dogmatism of pretentious ignorance in all ages. He has a
Greek and Latin library,<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href="#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a> and pretends to have once read
Homer, although his recollections are rather confused. He
makes, for instance, Daedalus shut Niobe into the Trojan horse;
Iphigenia becomes the wife of Achilles; Helen is the sister of
Diomede and Ganymede.<a id="noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href="#note_779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> One of the more refined entertainments
which are provided is the performance of scenes

reading in a sonorous voice from a Latin version.<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a> He is himself

got their name from the dealer Corinthus. The metal came
from the fused bronze and gold and silver which Hannibal flung
into the flames of captured Troy. But Trimalchio’s most genuine
taste, as he naïvely confesses, is for acrobatic feats and loud
horn-blowing. And so, a company of rope-dancers bore the guests
with their monotonous performances.<a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href="#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> Blood-curdling tales of

imitates the notes of the nightingale, and another, apparently

The company at this strange party were worthy of their
host. And Petronius has outdone himself in the description
of these brother freedmen, looking up to Trimalchio as the
glory of their order, and giving vent to their ill-humour, their
optimism, or their inane moralities, in conversation with the
sly observer who reports their talk. They are all old slaves
like their host, men who have <span class="tei tei-q">“made their pile,”</span> or lost it.
They rate themselves and their neighbours simply in terms of
cash.<a id="noteref_787" name="noteref_787" href="#note_787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> The only ability they can understand is that which

even the few saving traits in the character of Trimalchio. He
has, after all, an honourable, though futile, ambition to be a
wit, a connoisseur, a patron of learning. His luxury is
coarse enough, but he wishes, however vainly, to redeem it by
some ingenuity, by interspersing the mere animal feeding with
some broken gleams, or, as we may think, faint and distorted
reflections, of that great world of which he had heard, but the
portals of which he could never enter. But his company are
of mere clay. Trimalchio is gross enough at times, but,
compared with his guests, he seems almost tolerable. And
their dull baseness is the more torturing to a modern reader
because it is an enduring type. The neighbour of the Greek
observer warns him not to despise his company;<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> they are

he has been compelled to compound with his creditors, and he
has played them a clever trick. A certain Seleucus, whose

up again by a good vintage and a lucky bequest, which he knew,
by a sly stroke, how to increase; a true son of fortune, who

deserved, at the call of the crowd, <span class="tei tei-q">‘give it them.’</span> A pretty
show indeed! When I applauded, I gave far more than I got.
But friend Agamemnon, you are thinking <span class="tei tei-q">‘what is all this
long-winded chatter.’</span><a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a> Well, you, who dote on eloquence, why
won’t you talk yourself, instead of laughing at us feeble folk.
Some day I may persuade you to look in at my farm; I daresay,
though the times are bad, we shall find a pullet to eat. And I
have a young scholar ripening for your trade. He has good
wits and never raises his head from his task. He paints with
a will. He has begun Greek, and has a real taste for Latin.
But one of his tutors is conceited and idle. The other is very
painstaking, but, in his excess of zeal, he teaches more than he
knows. So I have bought the boy some red-letter volumes,
that he may get a tincture of law for domestic purposes. That
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is what gives bread and butter. He has now had enough of
literature. If he gives it up, I think I shall teach him a trade,
the barber’s or auctioneer’s or pleader’s,<a id="noteref_802" name="noteref_802" href="#note_802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a> something that only
death can take from him. Every day I din into his ears,
Primigenius, my boy, what you learn you learn for profit. Look
at the lawyer Philero. If he had not learnt his business, he
could not keep the wolf from the door. Why, only a little
ago, he was a hawker with a bundle on his back, and now he
can hold his own with Norbanus. Learning is a treasure, and
a trade can never be lost.”</span>

To all this stimulating talk there are lively interludes. A
guest thinks one of the strangers, in a superior way, is making
game of the company, and assails him with a shower of the
choicest abuse, in malodorous Latin of the slums, interlarded
with proud references to his own rise from the slave ranks.<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a>
Trimalchio orders the house-dog, Scylax, to be brought in, but
the brute falls foul of a pet spaniel, and, in the uproar, a lamp
is overthrown, the vases on the table are all smashed, and
some of the guests are scalded with the hot oil.<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href="#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a> In the
middle of this lively scene, a lictor announces the approach of
Habinnas, a stone-cutter, who is also a great dignitary of the
town. He arrives rather elevated from another feast of which
he has pleasant recollections. He courteously asks for
Fortunata,<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href="#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a> who happens to be just then looking after the
plate and dividing the remains of the feast among the slaves.
That lady, after many calls, appears in a cherry coloured
tunic with a yellow girdle, wiping her hands with her neckerchief.
She has splendid rings on her arms, legs, and fingers,
which she pulls off to show them to the stone-cutter’s lady.
Trimalchio is proud of their weight, and orders a balance to
be brought in to confirm his assertions. It is melancholy to
relate that, in the end, the two ladies get hopelessly drunk,
and fall to embracing one another in a rather hysterical fashion.
Fortunata even attempts to dance.<a id="noteref_806" name="noteref_806" href="#note_806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a> In the growing confusion
the slaves take their places at table, and the cook begins to
give imitations of a favourite actor,<a id="noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a> and lays a wager with his
master on the chances of the green at the next races. Trimal<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chio, who by this time was becoming very mellow and sentimental,
determines to make his will, and to manumit all his
slaves, with a farm to one, a house to another. He even gives
his friend the stone-cutter full directions about the monument
which is to record so brilliant a career. There is to be ample
provision for its due keeping, in the fashion so well known
from the inscriptions, with a fair space of prescribed measurements,
planted with vines and other fruit trees. Trimalchio
wishes to be comfortable in his last home.<a id="noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href="#note_808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a> On the face of
the monument ships under full sail are to figure the sources
of his wealth.<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href="#note_809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a> He himself is to be sculptured, seated on
a tribunal, clothed with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praetexta</span></span> of the Augustalis,
with five rings on his fingers, ladling money from a bag,
as in the great banquet with which he had once regaled the
people.<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href="#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a> On his right hand there is to be the figure of his
wife holding a dove and a spaniel on a leash. A boy is to
be graved weeping over a broken urn. And, finally, in
the centre of the scene, there is to be a horologe, that the
passer-by, as he looks for the hour, may have his eyes
always drawn to the epitaph which recited the dignities and
virtues of the illustrious freedman. It told posterity that
<span class="tei tei-q">“C. Pompeius Trimalchio Maecenatianus was pious, stout, and
trusty, that he rose from nothing, left HS.30,000,000, and
never heard a philosopher.”</span> The whole company, along with
Trimalchio himself, of course wept copiously at the mere
thought of the close of so illustrious a career. After renewing
their gastric energy in the bath, the company fell to another
banquet. Presently a cock crows, and Trimalchio, in a fit of
superstition, spills his wine under the table,<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href="#note_811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a> passes his rings to
the right hand, and offers a reward to any one who will bring
the ominous bird. The disturber was soon caught and handed
over to the cook for execution. Then Trimalchio excites his
wife’s natural anger by a piece of amatory grossness, and, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>retaliation for her very vigorous abuse, flings a cup at her
head. In the scene which follows he gives, with the foulest
references to his wife’s early history, a sketch of his own career
and the eulogy of the virtues that have made him what he is.<a id="noteref_812" name="noteref_812" href="#note_812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a>
Growing more and more sentimental, he at last has himself
laid out for dead;<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href="#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> the horn-blowers sound his last lament,
one of them, the undertaker’s man, with such a good will, that
the town watch arrived in breathless haste with water and axes
to extinguish a fire. The strangers seized the opportunity to
escape from the nauseous scene. Their taste raised them
above Trimalchio’s circle, but they were quite on the level of
its morals. Encolpius and his companions are soon involved
in other adventures, in which it is better not to follow them.

The lesson of all this purse-proud ostentation and
vulgarity, the moral which Petronius may have intended to
point, is one which will be taught from age to age by descendants
of Trimalchio, and which will be never learnt till a far off
future. But we need not moralise, any more than Petronius.
We have merely given some snatches of a work, which is now
seldom read, because it throws a searching light on a class
which was rising to power in Roman society. We have now
seen the worst of that society, whether crushed by the
tyranny of the Caesars, or corrupted and vulgarised by sudden
elevation from ignominious poverty to wealth and luxury.
But there were great numbers, both among the nobles and the
masses, who, in that evil time, maintained the traditions of old
Roman soberness and virtue. The three following chapters
will reveal a different life from that which we have hitherto
been describing.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a great relief to turn from the picture of base and vulgar
luxury in the novel of Petronius to the sobriety and refinement
of a class which has been elaborately painted by a less skilful
artist, but a better man. The contrast between the pictures of
Petronius and those of Pliny, of course, raises no difficulty.
The writers belonged indeed to the same order, but they were
describing two different worlds. The difficulty arises when we
compare the high tone of the world which Pliny has immortalised,
with the hideous revelations of contemporary licence in
the same class which meet us in Juvenal, Martial, and Tacitus.
And historical charity or optimism has often turned the contrast
to account. But there is no need to pit the quiet testimony of
Pliny against the fierce invective of Juvenal. Indeed to do so
would indicate an imperfect insight into the character of the
men and the associations which moulded their views of the
society which surrounded them. The friends of Pliny were for
the most part contemporaries of the objects of Juvenal’s wrath
and loathing.<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a> But although the two men lived side by side
during the same years, and probably began to write for the
public about the same date,<a id="noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> there is no hint that they ever
met. They were socially at opposite poles; they were also as
widely separated by temperament. Pliny was a charitable, good-natured
man, an aristocrat, living among the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">élite</span></span>, with an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>assured position and easy fortune—a man who, as he admits
himself, was inclined to idealise his friends.<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a> He probably
shut his eyes to their moral faults, just as he felt bound in
honour to extol their third-rate literary efforts. Juvenal was,
as in a former chapter we have seen reason to believe, a
soured and embittered man, who viewed the society of the
great world only from a distance, and caught up the gossip of
the servants’ hall. With the heat of an excitable temperament,
he probably magnified what he heard, and he made
whole classes responsible for the folly and intemperance of a
few. Martial, the friend of Juvenal, lived in the same atmosphere,
but, while Juvenal was inspired by a moral purpose,
Martial caters, unabashed, for a prurient taste.<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> Both the
charitable optimist and the gloomy, determined pessimist, by
limiting their view, can find ample materials for their respective
estimates of pagan society towards the end of the first century.
A judicial criticism will combine or balance the opposing
evidence rather than select the witnesses.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The truth is that society in every age presents the most
startling moral contrasts, and no single comprehensive description
of its moral condition can ever be true. This has
been too often forgotten by those who have passed judgment
on the moral state of Roman society, both in the first age of the
Empire and in the last. That there was stupendous corruption
and abnormal depravity under princes like Caligula, Nero, and
Domitian, we hardly need the testimony of the satirists to
induce us to believe. That there were large classes among
whom virtuous instinct, and all the sober strength and gravity
of the old Roman character, were still vigorous and untainted,
is equally attested and equally certain. Ingenious immorality
and the extravagance of luxury were no doubt rampant in the
last century of the Republic and in the first century of the
Empire, and their enormity has been heightened by the perverted
and often prurient literary skill with which the orgies of
voluptuous caprice have been painted to the last loathsome
details. Yet even Ovid has a lingering ideal of womanly
dignity which may repel, by refined reserve, the audacity of
libertinism.<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> He was forced, by old-fashioned scruple or
imperial displeasure, to make an elaborate apology for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lubricities of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ars Amandi</span></span>.<a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819" href="#note_819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a> The most wanton writer of
the evil days shrinks from justifying adultery, and hardly ever
fails to respect the unconscious innocence of girlhood. In the
days when, according to Juvenal, Roman matrons were eloping
with gladiators, and visiting the slums of Rome, Tacitus and
Favorinus were preaching the duties of a pure motherhood.<a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href="#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a>
In the days when crowds were gloating over the obscenities of
pantomime, and aristocratic dinner-parties were applauding the
ribaldry of Alexandrian songs, Quintilian was denouncing the
corruption of youth by the sight of their fathers toying with
mistresses and minions.<a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href="#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a> In an age when matrons of noble rank
were exposing themselves at the pleasure of an emperor, the
philosopher Musonius was teaching that all indulgence, outside
the sober limits of wedlock, was a gross, animal degradation of
human dignity.<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> And it is thus we may balance Juvenal and
Martial on the one side and Pliny on the other. The gloomy
or prurient satirist gives us a picture of ideal baseness; the
gentle and charitable aristocrat opens before us a society in which
people are charmingly refined, and perhaps a little too good.
Yet it is said with truth that an age should be judged by its
ideals of goodness rather than by its moral aberrations. And
certain it is that the age of Pliny and Tacitus and Quintilian
had a high moral ideal, even though it was also the age of
Domitian. The old Roman character, whatever pessimists,
ancient or modern, may say, was a stubborn type, which
propagated itself over all the West, and survived the
Western Empire. It is safe to believe that there was in Italy
and Gaul and Spain many a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">grand seigneur</span></span> of honest, regular
life, virtuous according to his lights, like Pliny’s uncle, or his
Spurinna, or Verginius Rufus, or Corellius. There were
certainly many wedded lives as pure and self-sacrificing as
those of the elder Arria and Caecina Paetus, or of Calpurnia
and Pliny.<a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> There were homes like those at Fréjus,<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> or
Como, or Brescia,<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href="#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a> in which boys and girls were reared in a
refined and severe simplicity, which even improved upon the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tradition of the golden age of Rome. And, as will be seen
in a later chapter, many a brief stone record remains which
shows that, even in the world of slaves and freedmen, there
were always in the darkest days crowds of humble people,
with honest, homely ideals, and virtuous family affection,
proud of their industries, and sustaining one another by help
and kindness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this sounder class of Roman society, it will be found
that the saving or renovating power was, not so much any
religious or philosophic impulse, as the wholesome influence,
which never fails from age to age, of family duty and affection,
reinforced, especially in the higher ranks, by a long tradition of
Roman dignity and self-respect, and by the simple cleanness and
the pieties of country life. The life of the blameless circle of
aristocrats which Pliny determined to preserve for the eyes of
posterity, seems to be sometimes regarded as the result of a
sudden transformation, a rebound from the frantic excesses of
the time of the Claudian Caesars to the simpler and severer
mode of life of which Vespasian set a powerful example. That
there was such a change of moral tone, especially in the
class surrounding the court, partly caused by financial exhaustion,
partly by the introduction of new men from the
provinces into the ranks of the Senate, is certified by the
supreme authority of Tacitus.<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> Yet we should remember that
men like Agricola, the father-in-law of Tacitus, or Verginius
Rufus, or Fabatus, the grandfather of Pliny’s wife, or the
elder Pliny, and many another, were not converted prodigals.
They knew how to reconcile, by quietude or politic deference,
the dignity of Roman virtue with a discreet acquiescence even
in the excesses of despotism. The fortunes of many of them
remained unimpaired. The daily life of men like the elder
Pliny and Spurinna, is distinguished by a virtuous calm, an
almost painful monotony of habit, in which there seems to
have been nothing to reform except, perhaps, a certain moral
rigidity.<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> Above all, and surely it is the most certain proof
and source of the moral soundness of any age, the ideal of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>womanhood was still high, and it was even then not seldom
realised. There may have been many who justified the
complaint of moralists that mothers did not guard with
vigilant care the purity of their children. But there were
women of the circle of Tacitus and Pliny as spotless as the
half-legendary Lucretia, as they were far more accomplished,
and probably far more charming. It is often said that women
sink or rise according to the level of the men with whom they
are linked. If that be true, there must have been many good
men in the days of the Flavian dynasty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The younger Pliny, whose name, before his adoption, was
Publius Caecilius Secundus,<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href="#note_828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a> was descended from families which
had been settled at Como since the time of the first Caesar.<a id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829" href="#note_829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a>
They belonged to the local aristocracy, and possessed estates
and villas around the lake. Pliny’s father, who had held high
municipal office, died early, but the boy had the great advantage
of the guardianship of Verginius Rufus, for whose
character and achievements his ward felt the profoundest
reverence.<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href="#note_830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a> That great soldier had been governor of Upper
Germany at the close of Nero’s reign, and, with a deference
to old constitutional principles, which Pliny must have
admired, had twice, at the peril of his life, refused to receive
the imperial place at the hands of his clamorous legions.<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a>
Pliny was born in 61 or 62 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, the time which saw the death
of Burrus, the retirement of Seneca from public life, and
the marriage of Nero with Poppaea.<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href="#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> His infancy therefore
coincided with the last and wildest excesses of the Neronian
tyranny. But country places like Como felt but little of the
shock of these moral earthquakes. There was no school in
Como till one was founded by Pliny’s own generosity.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> But
the boy had probably, in his early years, the care of his uncle,
the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural History</span></span>, who, during the worst
years of the Terror, was living, like many others, in studious
retirement on his estates.<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href="#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> The uncle and nephew were men
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of very different temperament, but there can be little doubt that
the character and habits of the older man profoundly influenced
the ideals of the younger. The elder Pliny would have
been an extraordinary character even in a puritan age; he
seems almost a miracle in the age of the Claudian Caesars.
He was born in 23 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, in the reign of Tiberius; and his early
youth and manhood cover the reigns of Caligula and Claudius.
He was only 32 when Nero came to the throne. He returned
to Rome in 71 to hold a high place in the councils of
Vespasian.<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> That more than monastic asceticism, that jealous

ordinary pleasures, in comparison with the duty, or the
ambition, of transmitting to future ages the accumulations
of learned toil, is a curious contrast to the Gargantuan
feasts or histrionic aestheticism which were the fashion in
the circle of the Claudian Emperors. The younger Pliny
has left us a minute account of his uncle’s routine of life,
and justly adds that the most intense literary toil might seem
mere idleness in comparison.<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a> His studies often began soon
after midnight, broken by an official visit to the emperor
before dawn. After administrative work was over, the remainder
of the day was spent in reading or writing. Even
in the bath or on a journey, this literary industry was never
interrupted. A reader or amanuensis was always at hand
to save the moments that generally are allowed to slip away
to waste. He tells Titus in his preface that he had consulted
2000 volumes for his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural History</span></span>.<a id="noteref_838" name="noteref_838" href="#note_838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a> The 160 volumes of
closely written notes, which the austere enthusiast could have
sold once for £3500, might have challenged the industry of a
Casaubon or a Mommsen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The laborious intensity of the elder Pliny was probably
unrivalled in his day. But the moral tone, the severe self-restraint,
the contempt for the sensual, or even the comfortable,
side of life, the plain unspeculative stoicism, was a tone which,
from many indications in the younger Pliny and in the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>literature of the time, appears to have been not so rare as the
reader of Juvenal or Martial might suspect. A book like the
Caesars of Suetonius, concentrating attention on the life of the
emperor and his immediate circle, is apt to suggest misleading
conclusions as to the condition of society at large. The old
Roman character, perhaps the strongest and toughest national
character ever developed, was an enduring type, and its true
home was in the atmosphere of quiet country places in northern
or central Italy, where the round of rural labour and simple
pleasures reproduced the environment in which it first took
form. We have glimpses of many of these nurseries or
retreats of old-fashioned virtue in Pliny’s Letters. Brescia
and Padua, in the valley of the Po, were especially noted for
frugality and severity.<a id="noteref_839" name="noteref_839" href="#note_839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">839</span></span></a> And it was from among the youth of
Brescia that Pliny suggested a husband for the daughter of
the stoic champion, Arulenus Rusticus. There must have been
many a home, like those of Spurinna, or Corellius Rufus, or
Fabatus,<a id="noteref_840" name="noteref_840" href="#note_840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a> or the poet Persius, where, far from the weary conventionality
of the capital, the rage for wealth, the rush of
vulgar self-assertion, there reigned the tranquil and austere
ideal of a life dedicated to higher ends than the lusts of the
flesh, or the ghoul-like avarice that haunted death-beds.
There are youths and maidens in the portrait-gallery of Pliny
whose innocence was guarded by good women as pure and
strong as those matrons who nursed the stern, unbending
soldiers of the Samnite and Punic wars.<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great struggle in which the legions of the East and
West met again, and yet again, in the valley of the Po, probably
did not much disturb the quiet homes on lake Como.
The close of that awful conflict gave the world ten years of
quiet and reformation, which were a genial atmosphere for the
formation of many characters like Pliny’s. The reign of
the Flavians was ushered in by the mystery and glamour of
Eastern superstition, by oracles on Mount Carmel and miracles
at Alexandria.<a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> But the plain Sabine soldier, who was the
saviour of the Roman State, brought to his momentous task
a clear unsophisticated good sense, with no trace of that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>crapulous excitement which had alternated between the heroics
of spurious art and the lowest bohemianism. Vespasian,
although he was not a figure to strike the imagination, was
yet, if we think of the abyss from which, by his single
strength, he rescued the Rome world,<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href="#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a> undoubtedly one of
the greatest of the emperors. And his biographer, with an
unusual tact, suggests what was probably one secret of his
strength. Vespasian regularly visited the old farmhouse at
Reate which was the cradle of his race. Nothing in the old
place was ever changed. And, on holidays and anniversaries
the emperor never failed to drink from the old silver goblet
which his grandmother had used.<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> The strength and virtue of
the Latin race lay, not in religion or philosophy, but in the
family pieties and devotion to the State. Vespasian found it
urgent to bring order into the national finances, which had been
reduced to chaos by the wild extravagance of his predecessors,
and to recruit the Senate, which had been more than decimated
by proscription, confiscation, and vicious self-abandonment.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a>
In performing his task, he did not shrink from the charge of
cheese-paring, just as he did not dread the unpopularity of
fresh taxation.<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> But he could be liberal as well as parsimonious.
He restored many of the ancient temples, even in
country places.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> He made grants to senators whose fortunes
had decayed or had been wasted.<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href="#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> He spent great sums on
colossal buildings and on amusements for the people.<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> But
the most singular and interesting trait in this remarkable man
is that, with no pretensions to literary or artistic culture, he
was the first Caesar who gave a fixed endowment to professors
of the liberal arts, and that he was the founder of that public
system of education<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href="#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> which, for good or evil, produced profound
effects on Roman character and intellect down to the end of the
Western Empire. His motive was not, as some have suggested,
to bring literature into thraldom to the State. He
was really making himself the organ of a great intellectual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>movement. For, while the vast field of administration absorbed
much of the energy of the cultivated class, the decay
of free institutions had left a great number with only a
shadow of political interest, and the mass of unoccupied talent
had to find some other scope for its energies. It found it for
ages, till the end of the Western Empire, in fugitive and
ephemeral composition, or in the more ephemeral displays of
the rhetorical class-room.<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a> Vespasian perhaps did a greater
service in renovating the upper class of Rome by the introduction
of many new men from the provinces, to fill the
yawning gaps in senatorial and equestrian ranks. Spain contributed
more than its fair share to the literature and statesmanship
of this period.<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a> And one of the best and most
distinguished sons of that province who found a career at
Rome, was the rhetor Quintilian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The young Pliny, under his uncle’s care, probably came to
Rome not long after Quintilian entered on his career of twenty
years, as a teacher of rhetoric.<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href="#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a> While the elder Pliny was one of
Vespasian’s trusted advisers, and regularly visited the emperor
on official business before dawn, his nephew was forming his
taste and character under the greatest and best of Roman
teachers. Quintilian left a deep impression on the younger
Pliny.<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href="#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> He made him a Ciceronian, and he fortified his
character. The master was one who believed that, in
education, moral influence and environment are even more
important than intellectual stimulus. He deplores the moral
risks to which the careless, self-indulgent parent, or the
corrupt tutor, may expose a boy in the years when the
destiny of a life is decided for better or worse. Intellectual
ambition is good. But no brilliancy of intellect will compensate
for the loss of the pure ingenuous peace of boyhood. This is
the faith of Quintilian, and it was also the faith of his pupil.<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855" href="#note_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a>
And it may be that the teaching of Quintilian had a larger
share in forming the moral ideals of the Antonine age in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>higher ranks than many more definitely philosophic guides,
whose practice did not always conform to their doctrine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quintilian’s first principle is that the orator must be a good
man in the highest and widest sense, and, although he will not
refuse to borrow from the philosophical schools, he yet boldly
asserts the independence of the oratorical art in moulding the
character of the man who, as statesman or advocate, will have
constantly to appeal to moral principles.<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a> This tone, combined
with his own high example of seriousness, honour, and the purest
domestic attachment,<a id="noteref_857" name="noteref_857" href="#note_857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> must have had a powerful effect on the
flower of the Roman youth, who were his pupils for nearly a
generation. There are none of his circle whose virtues Pliny
extols more highly than the men who had sat with him on the
same benches, and who accompanied or followed one another
in the career of public office. One of the dearest of these
youthful friends was Voconius Romanus, who, besides being
a learned pleader, with a keen and subtle intellect, was gifted
with a singular social charm and sweetness of manner.<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a>
Another was Cornutus Tertullus, who was bound to Pliny by
closer ties of sympathy than any of his friends, and for whose
purity of character he had a boundless admiration. They were
also united in the love and friendship of the best people of the
time.<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a> They were official colleagues in the consulship, and in
the prefecture of the treasury of Saturn. For another academic
friend, Julius Naso, who had been his loyal supporter in all
his work and literary ambitions, he earnestly begs the aid of
Fundanus, to secure him official advancement.<a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href="#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a> Calestrius
Tiro, who rose to be proconsul of the province of Baetica, must
be included in this select company. He had served with Pliny
in the army of Syria, and had been his colleague in the
quaestorship; they constantly visited one another at their
country seats.<a id="noteref_861" name="noteref_861" href="#note_861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">861</span></span></a> Such men, linked to one another by memories
of boyhood and by the cares of the same official career, must
have been a powerful and salutary element in social and
political life at the opening of the Antonine age.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a curious thing that, while Pliny lived in the closest
friendship with the Stoic opposition of Domitian’s reign, and
has unbounded reverence for its canonised saints, as we may
call them, he shows few traces of any real interest in speculative
philosophy. Indeed, in one passage he confesses that on such
subjects he speaks as an amateur.<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href="#note_862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a> He probably thought, like
his friend Tacitus, that philosophy was a thing to be taken
in moderation by the true Roman. It was when he was
serving on the staff in Asia that he formed a close friendship
with Artemidorus, whom Musonius chose for his daughter’s
hand.<a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863" href="#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> Pliny has not a word to say of his opinions, but he
extols his simplicity and genuineness—qualities, he adds, which
you rarely find in the other philosophers of the day. It was
at the same time that he formed a friendship with the Stoic
Euphrates. That philosopher, who is so studiously maligned
by Philostratus, was a heroic figure in Pliny’s eyes.<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> But what
Pliny admires in him is not so much his philosophy, as his
grave ornate style, his pure character, which showed none of that
harsh and ostentatious severity which was then so common in
his class. Euphrates is a polished gentleman after Pliny’s
own heart, tall and stately, with flowing hair and beard, a
man who excites reverence but not fear, stern to vice, but
gentle to the sinner. Pliny seems to have set little store by
the formal preaching of philosophy. In a letter on the uses
of sickness, he maintains that the moral lessons of the sick-bed
are worth many formal disquisitions on virtue.<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href="#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet this man, apparently without the slightest taste for
philosophic inquiry, or even for the homilies which, in his
day, had taken the place of real speculation, had a profound
veneration for the Stoic martyrs, and, true gentleman as he was,
he risked his life in the times of the last Terror to befriend
them. It needed both nerve and dexterity to be the friend
of philosophers in those days. In that perilous year, 93 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>,
when Pliny was praetor,<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> the philosophers were banished from
the city. Yet the praetor visited Artemidorus in his suburban
retreat, and, with his wonted generosity, he helped the philo<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sopher to wipe out a heavy debt which he had contracted.
One of Pliny’s dearest friends was Junius Mauricus, the
brother of Arulenus Rusticus, who had been put to death by
Domitian for writing a eulogy on Thrasea the Stoic saint,
the champion of the higher life in Nero’s reign.<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a> Junius
Mauricus afterwards suffered exile himself in the same cause.
He had charged himself with the care of his martyred
brother’s children, and Pliny helped him to find a worthy
husband for the daughter of Rusticus.<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a> With Fannia the
widow of Helvidius, and the daughter of Thrasea, Pliny’s
intimacy seems to have been of the closest kind. From her
he heard the tales, now too well worn, of the fierce firmness
of the elder Arria in nerving her husband Paetus for death,
and of her own determined self-immolation.<a id="noteref_869" name="noteref_869" href="#note_869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">869</span></span></a> The mother of
Fannia, the younger Arria, when Thrasea her husband was
condemned to die in the reign of Nero, was only prevented
from sharing his fate by the most earnest entreaties of her
friends.<a id="noteref_870" name="noteref_870" href="#note_870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a> Fannia had followed Helvidius into exile in Nero’s
reign,<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href="#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a> and again under Vespasian, when the philosopher, with a
petulance very unlike the reserve of Thrasea, brought his fate
upon himself by an insulting disregard of the emperor’s
dignity as first magistrate of the State, if not by revolutionary
tendencies.<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872" href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a> Fannia seems to have inherited many of the
great qualities of her father Thrasea, the noblest and the
wisest member of the Stoic opposition. He sprang from a
district in Lombardy which was noted for its soundness and
gravity of character. Unlike Paetus<a id="noteref_873" name="noteref_873" href="#note_873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">873</span></span></a> and Helvidius, he never
defied or intrigued against the emperor, even when the
emperor was a Nero. And, though he belonged to the
austere circle of Persius, he did not disdain to sing in tragic
costume, at a festival of immemorial antiquity, in his native
Patavium.<a id="noteref_874" name="noteref_874" href="#note_874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">874</span></span></a> He performed his duties as senator with firm
dignity, and yet with cautious tact. His worst political crime,
and that which proved his ruin, was a severe reserve and a
refusal to join in the shameful adulation of the matricide
prince. He would not stoop to vote divine honours to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>adulteress Poppaea, and for three years he absented himself
from the Senate-house.<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href="#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">875</span></span></a> Yet, when the end came, he would
not allow the fiery Arulenus Rusticus to imperil his future,
by interposing his veto as tribune.<a id="noteref_876" name="noteref_876" href="#note_876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a> His daughter Fannia
was worthy of her illustrious descent. She showed all the
fearless defiance of the elder Arria, when she boldly admitted
that she had asked Senecio to write her husband’s life, and
she uttered no word to deprecate her doom. When all her
property was confiscated, she carried the dangerous volume with
her to her place of exile.<a id="noteref_877" name="noteref_877" href="#note_877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">877</span></span></a> Yet this stern heroine had also
the tenderer virtues. She nursed her kinswoman Junia, one
of the Vestals, through a dangerous fever, and caught the seeds
of her own death from her charge. With all her masculine
firmness and courage, she had a sweetness and charm which
made her not less loved than venerated. With her may be
said to have expired the peculiar tradition of a circle which,
for three generations, and during the reigns of eight emperors,
guarded, sometimes with dangerous defiance, the old ideal of
uncompromising virtue in the face of a brutal and vulgar
materialism. It was the tradition which inspired the austere
detachment of the poetry of Persius, with its dim solemnity
and obscure depths, as of a sacred grove. These people were
hard and stern to vicious power,<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href="#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> like our own Puritans of
the seventeenth century. Like them too, they were exclusive
and defiant, with the cold hauteur of a moral aristocracy, a
company of the elect, who would not even parley with evil,
for whom the issues of life and death were the only realities
in a world hypnotised by the cult of the senses and the spell
of tyranny. Their intense seriousness was a religion, although
they had only the vaguest and most arid conception of God,
and the dimmest and least comforting conception of any future
life. They seemed to perish as a little sect of troublesome
visionaries; and yet their spirit lived on, softened and sweetened,
and passed into the great rulers of the Antonine age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before his formal period of military service as tribune of the
3rd Gallic legion in Syria, Pliny had, in his nineteenth year,
entered on that forensic career which was perhaps the greatest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pride of his life.<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href="#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a> He practised in the Centumviral court, which
was chiefly occupied with questions of property and succession.
Occasionally he speaks with a certain weariness of the trivial
character of the cases in which he was engaged. But his
general estimate is very different. The court is to him an
arena worthy of the greatest talent and industry,<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href="#note_880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a> and the
successful pleader may win a fame which may entitle him to
take rank with the great orators of the past. Pliny, inspired
by memories of Quintilian’s lectures, has always floating before
him the glory of Cicero.<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881" href="#note_881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a> He will prepare for publication a
speech delivered in an obscure case about a disputed will.<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href="#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a>
He is immensely proud of its subtlety and point, and the
sweep of its indignant or pathetic declamation, and he is not
unwilling to believe his legal friends who compared it with
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Corona</span></span>! The suppression of free political life, the
absence of public interests, and the extinction of the trade of
the delator, left young men with a passion for distinction few
chances of gratifying it. The law courts at any rate provided
an audience, and the chance of momentary prominence. In the
Letters of Pliny, we can see the young advocate pushing his
way through the dense masses of the crowded court, arriving
at his place with torn tunic, holding the attention of his
audience for seven long hours, and sitting down amid the
applause even of the judges themselves.<a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a> Calpurnia often

Youths of the highest social rank—a Salinator, or a Ummidius

on to the benches of the advocates, and engaged a body of
claqueurs whose applause was purchased for a few denarii.<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a>
Pliny has such a pride in this profession, he so idealises what
must have been often rather humdrum work, that he feels a
personal pain at anything which seems to detract from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>old-fashioned, leisurely dignity of the court. In his day the
judges seem to have been becoming more rapid and business-like
in their procedure, and less inclined to allow the many
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">clepsydrae</span></span> which men of Pliny’s school demanded for the
gradual development of all their rhetorical artifices. He
regrets the good old times, when adjournments were freely
granted,<a id="noteref_887" name="noteref_887" href="#note_887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a> and days would be spent on a case which was now
despatched in as many hours. It is for this reason that he
cannot conceal a certain admiration for Regulus, in other
respects, <span class="tei tei-q">“the most detestable of bipeds”</span> but who redeemed
his infamy by an enthusiasm and energy as an advocate
which rivalled even that of Pliny.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Aquilius Regulus, the prince of delators, and one of
the great glories of the Roman bar in Domitian’s reign, is a
singular figure. His career and character are a curious illustration
of the social history of the times. Regulus was the
son of a man who, in Nero’s reign, had been driven into exile
and ruined.<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href="#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> Bold, able, recklessly eager for wealth and
notoriety at any cost, as a mere youth he resolved to raise
himself from obscure indigence, and soon became one of the
most capable and dreaded agents of the tyranny. He gained
an evil fame by the ruin of the great houses of the Crassi and
Orfiti. Lust of blood and greed of gain drove him on
to the wholesale destruction of innocent boys, noble matrons,
and men of the most illustrious race. The cruelty of Nero
was not swift enough to satisfy him, and he called for the
annihilation of the Senate at a stroke. He rose rapidly to
great wealth, honours were showered upon him, and, after a
prudent retirement in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, he
reached the pinnacle of his depraved ambition under Vespasian’s
cruel son. He figures more than once in the poems of Martial,
and always in the most favourable light. His talent and
eloquence, according to the poet, were only equalled by his
piety, and the special care of the gods had saved him from
being buried under the ruins of a cloister which had suddenly
fallen in.<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a> He had estates at Tusculum, in Umbria and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Etruria.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> The courts were packed when he rose to plead.<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a>
Unfortunately, the needy poet furnishes a certain key to all
this flattery, when he thanks Regulus for his presents, and then
begs him to buy them back.<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> It is after Domitian’s death
that we meet Regulus in Pliny’s pages. The times are
changed, the delator’s day is over, and Regulus is a humbler
man. But he is still rich, courted, and feared; he is still a
great power in the law courts. With a weak voice, a bad
memory, and hesitating utterance,<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href="#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a> by sheer industry and
determination he had made himself a powerful speaker, with a
style of his own, sharp, pungent, brutally incisive, ruthlessly
sacrificing elegance to point.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a> He belonged to the new school,
and sometimes sneered at Pliny’s affectation of the grand
Ciceronian manner.<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href="#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a> Yet to Pliny’s eyes, his earnest
strenuousness in his profession redeems some of his vices. He
insists on having ample time to develop his case.<a id="noteref_896" name="noteref_896" href="#note_896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a> He appears
in the morning pale with study, wearing a white patch on his
forehead. He has consulted the diviners as to the success of
his pleadings.<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href="#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a> It is a curious sign of the times that this
great advocate, who already possessed an enormous fortune,
was a legacy-hunter of the meanest sort. He actually visited,
on her death-bed, Verania, the widow of that Piso, the adopted
son of Galba, over whose murder Regulus had savagely gloated,
and by telling her that the stars promised a hope of recovery,
he obtained a place in her will. His mourning for his son displayed
all the feverish extravagance and grandiose eccentricity
of a true child of the Neronian age.<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href="#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> The boy’s ponies and
dogs and pet birds were slaughtered over his pyre. Countless
pictures and statues of him were ordered. His memoir was
read by the father to a crowded audience, and a thousand
copies of it were sent broadcast over the provinces.<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a> In
Regulus we seem to see the type of character which, had
fortune raised him to the throne, would have made perhaps a
saner Caligula, and an even more eccentric Nero.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The struggles of the law courts were idealised by Pliny, and
their transient triumphs seemed to him to match the glory of
the Philippics or the Verrines. Yet, to do him justice, Pliny
had sometimes a truer idea of the foundations of lasting fame.
The secret of immortality, the one chance of escaping oblivion,
is to leave your thought embalmed in choice and distinguished
literary form, which coming ages will not willingly let die.<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href="#note_900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a>
This, probably the only form of immortality in which Pliny
believed, is the great motive for literary labour. The longing
to be remembered was the most ardent passion of the Roman
mind in all ages and in all ranks, from the author of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agricola</span></span> to the petty artisan, who commemorated the homely
virtues of his wife for the eyes of a distant age, and made provision
for the annual feast and the tribute of roses to the tomb.
Of that immense literary ambition which Pliny represented,
and which he considered it a duty to foster, only a small part
has reached its goal. The great mass of these eager litterateurs
have altogether vanished, or remain as mere shadowy names in
Martial or Statius or Pliny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poems of Martial and Statius leave the impression that, in
the reign of Domitian, the interest in poetical literature was keen
and widely diffused, and that, besides the poets by profession,
there were crowds of amateurs who dabbled in verse. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silvae</span></span>
transport us into a charming, if rather luxurious world, where men
like Atedius Melior or Pollius amuse themselves with dilettante
composition among their gardens and marbles on the bays of
Campania.<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a> Martial has a host of friends similarly engaged,
and the versatility of some of them is suspiciously wide. An
old Ardelio is twitted by Martial with his showy and superficial
displays in declamation and history, in plays and epigrams,
in grammar and astronomy.<a id="noteref_902" name="noteref_902" href="#note_902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a> Canius Rufus, his countryman
from Gades, Varro, Bassus, Brutianus, Cirinius, have all an
extraordinary dexterity in almost every branch of poetical
composition. Martial is too keen a critic not to see the
fugitive character of much of this amateur literature. Like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Juvenal, he scoffs at the thin talent which concealed its feebleness
behind the pomp and faded splendour of epic or tragic
tradition.<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a> He roughly tells the whole versifying crowd that
genius alone will live in coming ages. The purchased applause
of the recitation hall merely gratifies for an hour the vanity of
the literary trifler. It is a pity for his fame that Martial did
not always maintain this tone of sincerity. He can at times
sell his flattery to the basest and most stupid. He is capable
of implying a comparison of the frigid pedantry of Silius
Italicus to the majesty of Virgil.<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href="#note_904"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny was a friend and admirer of Martial, and, with his
usual generous hand, he made the poet a present when he
left Rome for ever to pass his last years at Bilbilis.<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href="#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a> The
needy epigrammatist was only a distant observer, or hanger-on
of that world of wealth and refinement in which Pliny was
a conspicuous figure. But from both Pliny and Martial we
get very much the same impression of the literary movement
in the reign of Domitian. Pliny himself is perhaps its best
representative. He is a true son of the Roman schools, as
they had been revived and strengthened by Vespasian, for a life
of many generations. Pliny does not think slightly of the
literary efforts of his own day: some of them he even overrates.
But already the Roman mind had bent its neck to that thraldom
to the past, to that routine of rhetorical discipline, which,
along with other causes, produced the combination of ambitious
effort and mediocre performance that, for the last three centuries
of the Empire, is the characteristic of all literary culture.
From his great teacher Quintilian Pliny had imbibed a profound
reverence for Cicero.<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906" href="#note_906"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a> Alike in his career of honours
and his literary pursuits, he loves to think that he is treading
in the great orator’s footsteps. In answer to a taunt of
Regulus, he once boldly avowed his preference for the Ciceronian
oratory to that of his own day. Demosthenes is also sometimes
his model, though he feels keenly the difference that
separates them.<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href="#note_907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> Indeed his reverence for Greece as the
mother of letters, art, and civic life was one of Pliny’s sincerest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and most honourable feelings. To a man who had been
appointed to high office in Greece he preaches, in earnest tones,
the duty of reverence for that gifted race whose age was consecrated
by the memories of its glorious prime.<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> Pliny’s Greek
studies must have begun very early. At the age of fourteen
he had written a Greek tragedy, for which, however, he modestly
does not claim much merit.<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href="#note_909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">909</span></span></a> He had always a certain taste
for poetry, but it seems to have been merely the taste created
or enforced by the constant study of the poets under the
grammarian. Once, while detained by bad weather on his way
back from military service in Asia, he amused himself with
composing in elegiac and heroic verse.<a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910" href="#note_910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">910</span></span></a> Later in his career, he
published a volume of poems in hendecasyllabic metre, written
on various occasions. But there was no inspiration behind
these conventional exercises. He was chiefly moved to write
in verse, as he naïvely confesses, by the example of the great
orators who beguiled their leisure in this way. Among his
published poems there were some with a flavour of Catullan
lubricity, which offended or astonished some of his severer
friends, who thought such doubtful lightness unworthy of a
grave character and a great position.<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> No better illustration
could be found of Pliny’s incorrigible conventionality in such
things than the defence which he makes of his suspected verses
to Titius Ariston.<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href="#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a> It is to Pliny not a question of morals or
propriety. The ancient models are to be followed, not only
in their elevated, but in their looser moods. The case seems
to be closed when Pliny can point to similar literary aberrations
in a long line of great men from Varro and Virgil and Cicero
to Verginius Rufus and the divine Nerva.<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny, however, though vain of his dexterity in these trifles,
probably did not rate them very highly. It was to oratorical
fame that his ambition was directed. He was dissatisfied with
the eloquence of his own day, which, to use the words of
Regulus, sprang at the throat of its subject, and he avowed
himself an imitator of Cicero. His speeches, even for the
centumviral court, were worked up with infinite care, although
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with too self-conscious an aim to impress an audience. We
can hardly imagine Cicero or Demosthenes coldly balancing
their tropes and figures after the fashion of Pliny. When the
great oratorical effort was over, the labour was renewed, in order
to make the speech worthy of the eyes of posterity. It was
revised and polished, and submitted to the scrutiny of critical
readers for suggestions of emendation.<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> Pliny was probably
the first to give readings of speeches to long-suffering friends.
We hear with a shudder that the recital of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span> was
spread over three days!<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a> The other speeches on which Pliny
lavished so much labour and thought, have perished, as they
probably deserved to perish. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span> was preserved,
and became the parent and model of the prostituted rhetoric
of the Gallic renaissance in the fourth century.<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href="#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a> Pliny was
by no means a despicable literary critic, when he was not
paying the tribute of friendly flattery which social tyranny
then exacted. He could sometimes be honestly reserved in his
appreciation of a friend’s dull literary efforts.<a id="noteref_917" name="noteref_917" href="#note_917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a> But in his
ideals of oratory, he seems to be hopelessly wrong. There are
some terse and epigrammatic sentences in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span>, which
redeem it by their strong sincerity. But Pliny’s canons of
oratorical style would have excited the ridicule of his great
models, who were thinking of their goal, and not measuring
every pace as they strained towards it. Pliny’s theory that the
mere length of a speech is a great element in its excellence, that
swift directness is inartistic, that lingering diffuseness is an
oratorical charm, that laboured manufacture of turgid phrases
may produce the effect of the impetuous rush of Demosthenes
and Cicero in their moments of inspiration, makes us rather
glad, who love him, that we have not more of Pliny’s oratory.<a id="noteref_918" name="noteref_918" href="#note_918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is by his letters that Pliny has lived, and will live on, so
long as men care to know the inner life of the great ages that
have gone before. The criticism, which is so quick to seize
the obvious weaknesses of the author of a priceless picture of
ancient society, seems to be a little ungrateful. We could forgive
almost any failing or affectation in one who had left us a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>similar revelation of society when M. Aurelius was holding
back the Germans on the Danube, or when Probus was shattering
the invaders of the third century. The letters of Cicero
offer an apparently obvious comparison, which may be used
to the detriment of Pliny. Yet the comparison is rather
inept. Cicero was a man of affairs in the thick of a great
revolution, and his letters are invaluable to the student of
politics at a great crisis in history. But in the calm of
Trajan’s reign, a letter-writer had to seek other subjects of
interest than the fortunes of the state. Literature, criticism,
the beauties of nature, the simple charm of country life,
the thousand trivial incidents and eccentricities of an over-ripe
society in the capital of the world, furnished a ready
pen and a genial imagination, which could idealise its surroundings,
with ample materials. Pliny is by some treated as a
mediocrity; but, like our own Horace Walpole, he had the keen
sense to see that social routine could be made interesting, and
that the man who had the skill to do so might make himself
famous. He was genuinely interested in his social environment.
And intense interest in one’s subject is one great secret
of literary success. Pliny had also the instinct that, if a
work is to live, it must have a select distinction of style,
which may be criticised, but which cannot be ignored. He
had the laudable ambition to put his thoughts in a form of
artistic grace which may make even commonplace attractive.
So good a judge as the late Mr. Paley did not hesitate to
put the Latinity of Pliny on the level of that of Cicero.
Pliny’s Letters, perhaps even more than the masterpieces of
the Augustine age, fascinated the taste of the fourth and fifth
centuries. They were the models of Symmachus and Sidonius,
who tried, but in very different fashion, to do for their age
what Pliny did for his.<a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href="#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like his imitators, Sidonius and Symmachus, Pliny intended
his Letters to go down to the future as a masterpiece of style,
and as a picture of his age. We know that the letters of Symmachus
were carefully preserved in duplicate by his scribes,
probably by his own instructions, although they were edited
and published by his son only after his death.<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a> Pliny, like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Sidonius, gave his Letters to the public in successive portions
during his life.<a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a> Like Sidonius too, he felt that he had not
the sustained power to write a consecutive history of his time
and the Letters of both are probably far more valuable. Pliny’s
first book opens with a kind of dedication to Septicius Clarus,
who was the patron of Suetonius, and who rose to be praetorian
prefect under Hadrian.<a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> Pliny appears to disclaim any
order or principle of arrangement in these books, but this
is the device of an artistic negligence. Yet it has been
proved by the prince of European scholars in our day that
both as to date and subject matter, Pliny’s Letters reveal
signs of the most careful arrangement. The books were
published separately, a common practice down to the end of
Roman literary history. The same subject reappears in the
same book or the next.<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href="#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a> Groups of letters dealing with the
same matter are found in their natural order in successive
books. The proof is made even clearer by the silence or
the express references to Pliny’s family relations. Finally, the
older men, who fill the stage in the earlier Letters, disappear
towards the end; while a younger generation, a Salinator or a
Ummidius Quadratus, are only heard of in the later. Men of
Pliny’s own age, like Tacitus or Cornutus Tertullus, meet us
from first to last. The dates at which the various books were
published have been fixed with tolerable certainty. It is
enough for our present purpose to say that the earliest letter
belongs to the reign of Nerva, and the ninth book was probably
given to the world a year or two before the writer was appointed
by Trajan to the office of imperial legate of Bithynia.<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is easy, as we have said, and apparently congenial to
some writers, to dwell on the vanity and self-complacency of
the writer of these letters. By some he seems to be regarded
chiefly as a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">poseur</span></span>. To discover the weaknesses of Pliny is
no great feat of criticism: they are on the surface. But
<span class="tei tei-q">“securus judicat orbis terrarum,”</span> and Pliny has borne the
scrutiny of the great judge. Men of his own race and age,
who spoke and wrote the most finished Latin, awarded him
the palm of exquisite style.  But Pliny has many qualities of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the heart, which should cover a multitude of sins, even more
serious than any with which he is charged. He had the great
gift of loyal friendship, and he had its usual reward in a
multitude of friends. It has been regretted that Pliny does
not deal with serious questions of politics and philosophy,
that his Letters rather skim the surface of social life, and
leave its deeper problems untouched. Pliny himself would
probably have accepted this criticism as a compliment. The
mass of men are little occupied with insoluble questions.
And Pliny has probably deserved better of posterity by leaving
us a vivid picture of the ordinary life of his time or of his
class, rather than an analysis of its spiritual distresses and
maladies. We have enough of that in Seneca, in M. Aurelius,
and in Lucian. Of the variety and vividness of Pliny’s
sketches of social life there can never be any question. But
our gratitude will be increased if we compare his Letters with
the collections of his imitators, Symmachus and Sidonius, whose
arid pages are seldom turned by any but a few curious and
weary students. Martial, in his way, is perhaps even more
clear-cut and minute in his portraiture. But Martial is essentially
a wit of the town, viewing its vices, follies, and fashions
with the eye of a keen, but rather detached observer. In
reading Pliny’s Letters, we feel ourselves introduced into the
heart of that society in its better hours; and, above all, we seem
to be transported to those quiet provincial towns and secluded
country seats where, if life was duller and tamer than it was
in the capital, the days passed in a quiet content, unsolicited
by the stormier passions, in orderly refinement, in kindly
relations with country neighbours, and amid the unfading
charm of old-world pieties and the witchery of nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny has also done a great service in preserving a memorial
of the literary tone and habits of his time. Even in that
age of fertile production and too enthusiastic appreciation,
Pliny, like Seneca and Statius, has a feeling that the love
for things of the mind was waning.<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> And he deemed it
an almost religious duty, as Symmachus and Sidonius did
more than three centuries after him, to arouse the flagging
interest in letters, and to reward even third-rate literary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>effort with exuberant praise. He avows that it is a matter
of duty to admire and venerate any performance in a field
so difficult as that of letters.<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> Yet Pliny was not by any
means devoid of critical honesty and acumen. He could
be a severe judge of his own style. He expects candid
criticism from his friends, and receives it with gratitude and
good temper.<a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> This is to him, indeed, the practical purpose of
readings before final publication. He made emendations and
excisions in the Histories of Tacitus, which the great author
had submitted for his revision.<a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href="#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> In his correspondence with
Tacitus, there is a curious mixture of vanity along with a clear
recognition of his friend’s immense superiority of genius, and
a sure prescience of his immortal fame. He is proud to hear
their names coupled as chiefs of contemporary literature,<a id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a>
and he cherishes the hope that, united by loyal friendship
in life, they will go down together to a remote future.
When, in the year 106, Tacitus had asked him for an account
of the elder Pliny’s death, in the great eruption of Vesuvius,
Pliny expressed a firm belief that the book on which Tacitus
was then engaged was destined to an enduring fame.<a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a> He
was not quite so confident as to the immortality of Martial’s
work,<a id="noteref_931" name="noteref_931" href="#note_931"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">931</span></span></a> although he appreciates to the full Martial’s brilliant and
pungent wit. On the other hand, writing to a friend about the
death of Silius Italicus, he frankly recognises that the Epic of
the Punic War is a work of industry rather than of genius.<a id="noteref_932" name="noteref_932" href="#note_932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a> Yet
he cannot allow the author of this dull mechanical poem to
pass away without some record of his career.<a id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933" href="#note_933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> The death at
seventy-five of the last surviving consular of the Neronian
age, of the consul in whose year of office the tyranny of Nero
closed, inspired a feeling of pathos which was probably genuine,
in spite of the rather pompous and pedantic expression of it.
And although he wrote the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Punica</span></span>, a work which was almost
buried till the fifteenth century,<a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934" href="#note_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> Silius was probably a not
uninteresting person. He had been a delator under Nero, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had enjoyed the friendship of Vitellius, but he knew how to
redeem his character under the Flavian dynasty, and he had
filled the proconsulate of Asia with some credit.<a id="noteref_935" name="noteref_935" href="#note_935"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">935</span></span></a> Henceforth
he enjoyed the lettered ease and social deference which were
the privilege of his class for centuries. He retired finally
to the shores of Campania, where, moving from one villa to
another, and surrounding himself with books and gems of
art, his life flowed away undisturbed by the agony of Rome
in the last terror of the Caesars. Among his many estates
he was the proud owner of one of Cicero’s villas, and of the
ground where Virgil sleeps. He used to keep the great poet’s
birthday with a scrupulous piety, and he always approached
his tomb as a holy place. This apparently placid and fortunate
life was, like so many in those days, ended by a voluntary
death.<a id="noteref_936" name="noteref_936" href="#note_936"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">936</span></span></a> Silius Italicus, in his life and in his end, is a true type
of a generation which could bend before the storm of despotism,
and save itself often by ignominious arts, which could recover
its dignity and self-respect in the pursuit of literary ideals,
and, at the last, assert the right to shake off the burden of
existence when it became too heavy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny’s theory of life is clearly stated in the Letters, and it
was evidently acted on by a great number of the class to which
he belonged.<a id="noteref_937" name="noteref_937" href="#note_937"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">937</span></span></a> The years of vigorous youth should be given to
the service of the state, in pursuing the well-marked and carefully-graduated
career of honours, or in the strenuous oratorical
strife of the law courts. The leisure of later years might be
portioned out between social duty, the pleasures or the cares
of a rural estate, and the cultivation of literary taste by reading
and imitation of the great masters. The last was the most
imperious duty of all, for those with any literary gifts, because
charm of style gives the one hope of surviving the wreck of
time;<a id="noteref_938" name="noteref_938" href="#note_938"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">938</span></span></a> for mere cultivated facility, as the most refined and
creditable way of filling up the vacant spaces of life. Even if
lasting fame was beyond one’s reach, it was something to be
able to give pleasure to an audience of cultivated friends at
a reading, and to enjoy the triumph of an hour. There must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have been many a literary coterie who, if they fed one another’s
vanity, also encouraged literary ideals, and hinted gentle criticism,<a id="noteref_939" name="noteref_939" href="#note_939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a>
in that polite delicacy of phrase in which the Roman
was always an adept. One of these literary circles stands out
in Pliny’s pages. At least two of its members had held great
office. Arrius Antoninus, the maternal grandfather of the
Emperor Antoninus Pius,<a id="noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href="#note_940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> had twice borne the consulship
with antique dignity, and shown himself a model governor as
proconsul of Asia.<a id="noteref_941" name="noteref_941" href="#note_941"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">941</span></span></a> He was devoted to Greek literature, and
seems to have preferred to compose in that language. We
need not accept literally Pliny’s praises of his Atticism, and
of the grace and sweetness of his Greek epigrams. But he
seems to have had a facility which Pliny tortured his ingenuity
in vain to imitate with the poorer resources of the Latin
tongue.<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href="#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a> Among the friends of Antoninus was Vestricius
Spurinna, who had defended Placentia for Otho, who was
twice consul under Domitian, and was selected by Trajan to
command the troops in a campaign in Germany.<a id="noteref_943" name="noteref_943" href="#note_943"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">943</span></span></a> This dignified
veteran, who had passed apparently untainted through the
reigns of the worst emperors, varied and lightened the ordinary
routine of his old age by the composition of lyrics, both in
Greek and Latin, which seemed to his admirers to have a
singular sweetness. Sentius Augurinus, a familiar friend of
the two consulars, was also a brilliant verse writer,<a id="noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href="#note_944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a> who could
enthral Pliny by a recitation lasting for three days, although
the fact that Pliny was the subject of one of the poems may
account for the patience or the pleasure. One of Pliny’s
dearest friends was Passennus Paullus, who claimed kindred
with the poet Propertius, and, at any rate, came from the
same town in Umbria. Passennus has been cruelly treated by
Time, if his lyric efforts recalled, as we are asked to believe,
the literary graces of his ancestor, and even those of Horace.<a id="noteref_945" name="noteref_945" href="#note_945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">945</span></span></a>
Vergilius Romanus devoted himself to comedy, and was thought
to have reproduced not unworthily the delicate charms of
Menander and Terence, as well as the scathing invective of older
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Greek masters of the art.<a id="noteref_946" name="noteref_946" href="#note_946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">946</span></span></a> But there were others of Pliny’s
circle who essayed a loftier and weightier style. Probably the
foremost of these was Titinius Capito, who, as an inscription
records,<a id="noteref_947" name="noteref_947" href="#note_947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">947</span></span></a> had held high civil office under Domitian, Nerva, and
Trajan. He was an enthusiastic patron of letters, and readily
offered his halls to literary friends for their recitations, which
he attended with punctilious politeness. Cherishing the
memory of the great men of the Republic, the Cassii, the
Bruti, and the Catos, he composed a work on the death of the
noble victims of the Terror.<a id="noteref_948" name="noteref_948" href="#note_948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">948</span></span></a> He tried in vain to draw Pliny
into the field of historical composition.<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href="#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> But the man who
thought more of style and graceful charity than of truth, was
not the man to write the history of such a time. He has done
a much greater service in providing priceless materials for the
reconstruction of its social history. Caninius Rufus was a
neighbour of Pliny at Como.<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href="#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a> He was one of those for whom
the charms of country life had a dangerous seduction. His
villa, with its colonnades, <span class="tei tei-q">“where it was always spring,”</span> the
shining levels of the lake beneath his verandah, the water
course with its emerald banks, the baths and spacious halls,
all these delights seem to have relaxed the literary energy and
ambition of their master. Caninius meditated the composition
of a Greek epic on the Dacian wars of Trajan.<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> But he was
probably one of those lingering, dilatory writers who meet us in
Martial,<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952" href="#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a> waiting for the fire from heaven which never comes.
The intractable roughness of barbarian names, which, as Pliny
suggests, might have been eluded by a Homeric licence in
quantity, was probably not the only difficulty of Caninius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the literary friends of Pliny, a much more important
person than Caninius was Suetonius, but Suetonius was
apparently long paralysed by the same cautious hesitation to
challenge the verdict of the public. A younger man than
Pliny,<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> Suetonius was one of his most intimate friends. They
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>both belonged to that circle which nursed the senatorial tradition
and the hatred of the imperial tyrants.<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> The life of
Suetonius was not very effectual or brilliant, from a worldly
point of view. Although born within the rank to which every
distinction was open,<a id="noteref_955" name="noteref_955" href="#note_955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a> he was a man of modest and retiring
tastes, devoted to quiet research, and destitute of the eager
ambition and vigorous self-assertion which are necessary for
splendid success. He was probably for some years a professor
of grammar.<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> He made a half-hearted attempt to gain a footing
at the bar. In 101 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> he obtained a military tribunate,
through Pliny’s influence, but speedily renounced his command.<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a>
Henceforth he devoted himself entirely to that historical
research, which, if it has not won for him any dazzling
fame, has made historical students, in spite of some reservations
as to his sources, his debtors for all time. Pliny had the
greatest esteem for Suetonius, and was always ready to befriend
him, whether it were in the purchase of a quiet little
retreat near Rome,<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> or in obtaining for the childless antiquary
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jus trium liberorum</span></span> from Trajan.<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href="#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> The two men were
bound to one another by many tastes and sympathies, not the
least strong being a curious superstition, which infected, as we
shall see in a later chapter, even the most vigorous minds of
that age. Suetonius had once a dream which seemed to
portend failure in some legal cause in which he was engaged.
He sought the aid of Pliny to obtain an adjournment. Pliny
does not question the reality of such warnings, but merely
suggests a more cheering interpretation of the vision.<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a>
Although devoted to research, and a most laborious student,
the biographer of the Caesars was strangely tardy in letting his
productions see the light. In 106, he had been long engaged
on a work, which was probably the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Viris Illustribus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> Pliny
assailed him with bantering reproaches on his endless use of
the file, and begs him to publish without delay. From several
indications, it appears that the lingering volume did not appear
till 113.<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> It was not till the year 118, when Hadrian arrived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from the East after his accession, that Suetonius attained the
rank of one of the imperial secretaryships.<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href="#note_963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">963</span></span></a> Pliny in all probability
had died some years before the elevation of his friend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although the dawn of a new age of milder and less
suspicious government had, for the first time since Augustus,
left men free to compose a true record of the past, and even
to vilify the early Caesars,<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href="#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> the great mass of cultivated men
in Pliny’s time, as in the days of Ausonius and Sidonius, were
devoted to poetry. The chief cause in giving this direction to
the Roman mind was undoubtedly the system pursued in the
schools. In the first century, as in the fifth, the formative
years of boyhood were devoted almost entirely to the study of
the poets. The subject-matter of their masterpieces was not
neglected by the accomplished grammarian, who was often
a man of learning, and sometimes a man of taste; and the
reading of poetry was made the text for disquisitions on
geography and astronomy, on mythology or the antiquities
of religious ritual and constitutional lore.<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href="#note_965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">965</span></span></a> But style
and expression were always of foremost interest in these
studies. The ear of the South has always felt the charm of
rhythmical or melodious speech, with a keenness of pleasure
generally denied to our colder temperament. And the Augustan
age had, in a single generation, performed miracles, under
Greek inspiration, in moulding the Latin tongue to be the
apt vehicle of every mood of poetic feeling. That inspired
band of writers, whose call it was to glorify the dawn of a
world-wide empire and the ancient achievements of the Latin
race,<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966" href="#note_966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">966</span></span></a> rose to the full height of their vocation. They were
conscious that they were writing for distant provinces won
from barbarism, and for a remote posterity.<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href="#note_967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">967</span></span></a> They discovered
and revealed resources in the language, hitherto undreamt of.
They wedded to its native dignity and strength a brilliancy,
an easy grace and sprightliness, which positively ravished the
ear of the street boys in Pompeii, or of the rude dweller on
the Tanais or the Baetis.<a id="noteref_968" name="noteref_968" href="#note_968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a> In his own lifetime Virgil became
a popular hero. His Eclogues were chanted on the stage;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>verses of the Aeneid can still be seen, along with verses of
Propertius, scrawled on the walls of Campanian towns. Virgil,
when he visited Rome, was mobbed by admiring crowds. When
his poetry was recited in the theatre, the whole audience rose
to their feet as if to salute the emperor.<a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969" href="#note_969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">969</span></span></a> He had the doubtful
but significant honour of being recited by Alexandrian boys at
the coarse orgies of a Trimalchio.<a id="noteref_970" name="noteref_970" href="#note_970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">970</span></span></a> Never was a worthy fame
so rapidly and splendidly won: seldom has literary fame and
influence been so lasting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Flavian age succeeded to this great heritage. Already
there were ominous signs of a decay of originality and force, of
decadence in the language itself.<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a> The controversy between
the lovers of the new and the lovers of the archaic style was
raging in the reign of Vespasian, and can be still followed in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratoribus</span></span> of Tacitus, or even in the verses of Martial.<a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a>
Already the taste for Ennius and the prae-Ciceronian oratory had
set in, for the dialect of the heroes of the Punic Wars, even for
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Latin of the Twelve Tables,”</span><a id="noteref_973" name="noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a> a taste which was destined
to produce its Dead Sea fruit in the age of the Antonines. But
whoever might cavil at Cicero,<a id="noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a> no one ever questioned the
pre-eminence of Virgil, and he and his contemporaries were
still the models of a host of imitators. The mass of facile
talent, thrown back on itself by the loss of free republican
life and public interests, fascinated from earliest infancy by
the haunting cadences of the grand style, rushed into verse-writing,
to beguile long hours of idleness, or to woo a shadowy
fame at an afternoon recital, with a more shadowy hope of
future fame. The grand style was a charmer and deceiver. It
was such a perfect instrument, it was so protean in its various
power, it was so abundant in its resources, that a man of third-rate
powers and thin commonplace imagination, who had been
trained in skilful manipulation of consecrated phrase, might
for the moment delude himself and his friends by faint echoes
of the music of the golden age.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The brilliancy of inherited phrase concealed the poverty of
the literary amateur’s fancy from himself. And, even if he
were not deluded about his own powers, the practice in skilful
handling of literary symbols, which was acquired in the schools,
furnished a refined amusement for a too ample leisure. It is
clear from the dialogue <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratoribus</span></span>, and from Pliny’s Letters,
that the meditative life, surrounded by the quiet charm of stream
and woodland, far from the din and strife and social routine of
the great city,<a id="noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">975</span></span></a> attracted many people much more than the
greatest oratorical triumphs in the centumviral court, which,
after all, were so pale and bourgeois beside the glories of the
great ages of oratory. And although Aper, in the Dialogue of
Tacitus, sneers at the solitary and unsocial toil of the poet,
rewarded by a short-lived <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">succès d’estime</span></span>,<a id="noteref_976" name="noteref_976" href="#note_976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">976</span></span></a> there can be no
doubt that the ambition to cut a figure, even for a day, was
a powerful inspiration at a time when the ancient avenues to
fame had been closed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was to satisfy such ambitions that Domitian founded the
quinquennial competition on the Capitol, in the year 86 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>,<a id="noteref_977" name="noteref_977" href="#note_977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">977</span></span></a>
as well as the annual festival in honour of Minerva on the
Alban Mount. A similar festival, for the cultivation of Greek
poetry, had been established at Naples in honour of Augustus,
at which Statius had won the crown of corn-ears.<a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href="#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a> And Nero
had founded another, apparently only for his own glorification.<a id="noteref_979" name="noteref_979" href="#note_979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">979</span></span></a>
The festival established by Domitian was more important and
enduring. The judges were taken from the priestly colleges,
and, amid a concourse of the highest functionaries of the state,
the successful poet received his crown at the hands of the
emperor. The prospect of such a distinction drew competitors
from distant provincial parts. It is a curious illustration of
the power and the skill of the literary discipline of the schools
that, twice within a few years, the crown of oak leaves was
won by boys under fourteen years of age. The verses of one
of them may still be read upon his tomb.<a id="noteref_980" name="noteref_980" href="#note_980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">980</span></span></a>

But these infrequent chances of distinction could not suffice
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for the crowd of eager composers. In those days, although the

organised publishing system by which a new work could be
brought to the notice of the public.<a id="noteref_981" name="noteref_981" href="#note_981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a> The author had to
advertise himself by giving readings, to which he invited his

versifier, who will calmly finish a passage, after being cast
ashore from a shipwreck, makes himself a nuisance by his
recitations in the baths and porticoes of Croton, and is very
properly stoned by a crowd of street boys.<a id="noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="#note_985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a> No aspect of
social life is more prominent in the Letters of Pliny than the
reading of new works, epics, or lyrics, histories, or speeches,
before fashionable assemblies. A liberal patron like Titinius
Capito would sometimes lend a hall for the purpose. But the
reciter had many expenses, from the hire of chairs to the
fees to freedmen and slaves, who acted as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">claqueurs</span></span>. In
the circle of a man like Pliny, to attend these gatherings was
a sacred duty both to letters and to friendship. In a year
when there was a more than usually abundant crop of poets,
the eager advocate could boast that he had failed no one, even
in the month when the courts were busiest.<a id="noteref_986" name="noteref_986" href="#note_986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">986</span></span></a> Doubtless, many
of the fashionable idlers, who dawdled away their time in the
many resorts devoted to gossip and scandal, were glad to show
themselves in the crowd. Old friends would consider it a
duty to support and encourage the budding literary ambition
of a young aspirant of their set. Some sincere lovers of
literary art would be drawn by a genuine interest and a wish
to maintain the literary tradition, which was already betraying
signs of weakness and decay. But, to a great many, this duty,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>added to the endless round of other social obligations, was
evidently becoming repulsive and wearisome.<a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987" href="#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> Pliny could
listen with delight and admiration to Sentius Augurinus
reciting his poems for three long days.<a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988" href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a> He would calmly
expect his own friends to listen for as many days to a whole
volume of his poems, or to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Panegyric</span></span> on Trajan.<a id="noteref_989" name="noteref_989" href="#note_989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">989</span></span></a> Such was
his high breeding, his kindliness, and such was his passion for
literature in any form or of any quality, that he could hardly
understand how what to him seemed at once a pleasure and
duty should be regarded by others as an intolerable nuisance.
The conduct of such people is treated with some disdain in
one or two of the rare passages in which he writes of his
circle with any severity. Some of these fashionable folk,
after lingering in some place of gossip until the reading was
well advanced, would enter the hall with ostentatious reluctance,
and then leave before the end. Others, with an air
of superiority, would sit in stolid silence and disguise the
slightest expression of interest. This seemed to Pliny, not
only grossly bad manners, but also neglect of a literary duty.<a id="noteref_990" name="noteref_990" href="#note_990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">990</span></span></a>
The audience should not only encourage honest effort;
they should contribute their judgment to the improvement
of style. Pliny, like Aristotle, has an immense faith in the
collective opinion of numbers, even in matters of artistic
taste.<a id="noteref_991" name="noteref_991" href="#note_991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">991</span></span></a> He used to read his own pieces to successively wider
circles, each time receiving suggestions for amendment.
Many of Pliny’s Letters, like the dialogue <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratoribus</span></span>, reveal
the keenness with which in those days questions of style were
debated. But, as in the circle of Sidonius, this very energy
of criticism was perhaps due to a dim consciousness of waning
force.<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992" href="#note_992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">992</span></span></a> Pliny, with all his kindly optimism, lets fall a phrase
here and there which betrays an uneasiness about the future
of letters.<a id="noteref_993" name="noteref_993" href="#note_993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">993</span></span></a> Enthusiasm is failing. Nay, there is a hardly
veiled contempt for that eager mediocrity which Pliny and
Titinius Capito made it a point of honour to encourage. We
feel that we are on the edge of that arid desert of cultivated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impotence in which the freshness and vigour of Roman
literature was soon mysteriously to disappear.

Great as were the attractions of the capital, its gay social
circles with their multifarious engagements, its games and
spectacles, and literary novelties, yet the most devoted
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ardelio,”</span> in the end, felt the strain and the monotony to be
oppressive.<a id="noteref_994" name="noteref_994" href="#note_994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">994</span></span></a> Seneca and Pliny, Martial and Juvenal,<a id="noteref_995" name="noteref_995" href="#note_995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">995</span></span></a> from
various points of view, lament or ridicule the inanity and the
slavery of city life. Roman etiquette was perhaps the most
imperious and exacting that ever existed. Morning receptions,
punctilious attendance at the assumption of the toga, at
betrothals, or the sealing of wills, or the reading of some tedious
epic, advice or support in the law courts, congratulations to
friends on every official success, these duties, and many others,
left men, who had a large circle of acquaintance, hardly a moment
of repose. Hence the rapture with which Pliny escapes to
the stillness of the Laurentine pine woods, or the pure cold
breezes that blew from the Apennines over his Tuscan seat.<a id="noteref_996" name="noteref_996" href="#note_996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">996</span></span></a>
In these calm solitudes the weary advocate and man of letters
became for a little while his own master, and forgot the din
and crush of the streets, the paltry ambitions, the malevolent
gossip and silly rumours of the great world, in some long-suspended
literary task. There can be no doubt that an intense
enjoyment was becoming more and more felt in country
life. Its unbought, home-grown luxuries, its common sights
and sounds, its antique simplicity, have a strange charm even
for a hardened bohemian like Martial.<a id="noteref_997" name="noteref_997" href="#note_997"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">997</span></span></a> But Pliny, besides this
commoner form of enjoyment, has a keen and exquisite feeling for
beauty of scenery. He loves the amphitheatre of hills, crowned
with immemorial forest that looks down on rich pastoral slope,
or vineyard or meadow, bright with the flowers of spring, and
watered by the winding Tiber; he loves the scenery of Como,
where you watch the fishermen at his toils from some retreat
on the terraced banks.<a id="noteref_998" name="noteref_998" href="#note_998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">998</span></span></a> Where in ancient literature can you
find a more sharp and clear-cut picture of a romantic scene than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in his description of the Clitumnus?<a id="noteref_999" name="noteref_999" href="#note_999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">999</span></span></a> The famous stream rises
under a low hill, shaded by ancient cypresses, and broadens
into a basin in whose glassy ice-cold waters you may count the
pebbles. Soon the current grows broader and swifter, and the
barges are swept along under groves of ash and poplar, which,
so vivid is their reflection, seem to be growing in the river-bed.
Hard by, is a temple of the river-god, with many other chapels,
and a seat of ancient augury; the magic charm of antique religious
awe blends with the witchery of nature, and many a villa
is planted on fair spots along the banks. There was plenty of
sport to be had in the Apennines or the Laurentine woods. But
Pliny was plainly not a real sportsman. He once tells his friend
Tacitus, who seems to have rallied him on this failing, that
although he has killed three boars, he much prefers to sit,
tablets in hand beside the nets, meditating in the silent glade.<a id="noteref_1000" name="noteref_1000" href="#note_1000"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1000</span></span></a>
The country is charming to Pliny, but its greatest charm lies in
the long tranquil hours which can be given to literary musing.
Part of the well-regulated day of Spurinna, a man who had commanded
armies and governed provinces, and who had reached
his seventy-seventh year, is devoted to lyric composition both
in Greek and Latin.<a id="noteref_1001" name="noteref_1001" href="#note_1001"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1001</span></span></a> Pliny once or twice laments the mass
of literary talent which, from diffidence or love of ease, was
buried in these rural retreats.<a id="noteref_1002" name="noteref_1002" href="#note_1002"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1002</span></span></a> There must have been many
a country squire, like that Terentius, who, apparently lost in
bucolic pursuits, surprised his guest by the purity of his taste
and his breadth of culture. We often meet the same buried
talent after nearly four centuries in the pages of Sidonius.<a id="noteref_1003" name="noteref_1003" href="#note_1003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1003</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The literature of the Flavian age has preserved for us many
pictures of Roman villas. They occupied every variety of site.
They were planted on rocks where the sea-foam flecked their
walls,<a id="noteref_1004" name="noteref_1004" href="#note_1004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1004</span></span></a> or on inland lakes and rivers, embowered in woods, or
on the spurs of the Apennines, between the ancient forest and
the wealthy plain.<a id="noteref_1005" name="noteref_1005" href="#note_1005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1005</span></span></a> Some of these mansions were remote and
secluded. But on the Bay of Naples, on the Laurentine

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Building in the days of Domitian was as much the rage as
it was in the days of Horace, and, just as then, all natural
obstacles were defied in preparing a site to the builder’s
taste. In the grounds of Pollius Felix in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silvae</span></span>, whole
hills had been levelled, and rocks had been cleared away to
make a space for the house with its gardens and woodlands.<a id="noteref_1007" name="noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1007</span></span></a>
Manlius Vopiscus had built two luxurious seats on opposite
banks of the Anio, where the stream glides silently under
overarching boughs.<a id="noteref_1008" name="noteref_1008" href="#note_1008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1008</span></span></a> The villas pressed so close to the water
that you could converse, and almost touch hands, across the
interval between them. The love of variety, or the obligation
imposed on senators to invest a third of their fortune in Italian
land,<a id="noteref_1009" name="noteref_1009" href="#note_1009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1009</span></span></a> may account for the number of country seats possessed

It is by no means an easy task, and perhaps not a very
profitable one, to trace minutely the arrangement of one of
these great houses. Indeed there seems to have been a good
deal of caprice and little care for symmetry in their architecture.
The builder appears to have given no thought to external
effect. To catch a romantic view from the windows, to escape
the sultry heat of midsummer, or woo the brief sunshine of
December, above all to obtain perfect stillness, were the objects
which seem to have dictated the plans of the Roman
architect.<a id="noteref_1014" name="noteref_1014" href="#note_1014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1014</span></span></a> The Laurentine villa of Pliny and the Surrentine
of Pollius Felix from their windows or colonnades gave glimpses
of forest or mountain, or sea, or fat herds browsing on the
meadow grass, or a view seaward to the islands off the

brightened by the glow of evening. Here is a colonnade
where in winter you can pace up and down with shutters
closed on the weather side, or in spring-time enjoy the scent
of violets and the temperate sunshine.<a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a> In the mansions on
the Anio, there is, according to Statius, an air of everlasting
quietness, never broken even by wandering wind, or ripple
of the stream.<a id="noteref_1017" name="noteref_1017" href="#note_1017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1017</span></span></a> Pliny has a distant room at Laurentum, to

Thus these villas threw out their chambers far and wide,
meandering in all directions, according to the fancy of the
master, or the charms of the neighbouring scenery.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The luxury of the Roman villa consisted rather in the
spaciousness and variety of building, to suit the changing
seasons, than in furniture for comfort or splendour. There were,
indeed, in many houses some costly articles, tables of citrus and
ivory, and antique vases, of priceless worth.<a id="noteref_1019" name="noteref_1019" href="#note_1019"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1019</span></span></a> But the chambers
of the most stately houses would probably, to modern taste, seem
scantily furnished. It was on the walls and ceiling and columns
that the Roman of taste lavished his wealth. The houses of
Pliny, indeed, seem to have been little adorned by this sort of
costly display.<a id="noteref_1020" name="noteref_1020" href="#note_1020"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1020</span></span></a> But the villa of Pollius Felix, like the baths
of Claudius Etruscus, shone with all the glory of variegated
marbles on plaque and pillar, drawn from the quarries of
Phrygia, Laconia, and Syene, Carystus and Numidia.<a id="noteref_1021" name="noteref_1021" href="#note_1021"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1021</span></span></a> Pliny
confesses that he is not a connoisseur in art. He speaks
with hesitation of the merit of a Corinthian bronze which he
has acquired.<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> But he was surrounded in his own class by
artistic enthusiasm, much of it, it is to be feared, pretentious
and ignorant. The dispersion of the artistic wealth of Greek
lands had flooded Italy with the works of the great masters.
Collectors of them, like Silius Italicus, abounded. The
fashion became so general and so imperious, that it penetrated
even into the vulgar circle of people like Trimalchio, who, in
interpreting the subject of the chasing on a cup, could confuse
the Punic and the Trojan wars. In the villas described
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by Statius, it would seem that the art of Apelles, Pheidias,
Myron, and Polycletus adorned the saloons and colonnades.<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href="#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a>
It may be doubted, however, whether many of these works
could claim such illustrious parentage. There was plenty of
facile technique in those days which might easily deceive the
vulgar collector by more or less successful reproduction.<a id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a> The
confident claim to artistic discrimination was not less common
in the Flavian age than in later days, and it was probably as
fallible. It is rather suspicious that, in the attempts at
artistic appreciation in this period, attention seems to be
concentrated on the supposed antiquity, rarity, or costliness of
material. There is little in the glowing descriptions in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silvae</span></span> to indicate a genuine appreciation of real art.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is possible that the great Roman country seat, in its vast
extent, although not in the stateliness of its exterior, may have
surpassed the corresponding mansions of our time. It was the
expression in stone of the dominant passion of an enormously
wealthy class, intoxicated with the splendour of imperial power,
and ambitious to create monuments worthy of an imperial
race. Moreover, the Roman’s energy always exulted in
triumphing over natural difficulties. Just as he drove his
roads unswerving over mountain and swamp, so he took a
pride in rearing his piles of masonry on the most obstinate
and defiant sites, or even in the middle of the waves. But, in
the extent of their parks, and the variety of floral display, the
Romans of the most luxurious age seldom reached the modern
English standard. The grounds of the villas which, in thick
succession, lined the Laurentine or Campanian shore, cannot
have been very extensive. Pliny has splendid views from his
windows of forest, mountain, and meadow, but the scene lies
plainly beyond the bounds of his demesne.<a id="noteref_1025" name="noteref_1025" href="#note_1025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a> The gardens and
shrubberies are very artificial, arranged in terraces or labyrinths
close to the house, or with hedges of box clipped into shapes of
animals along an open colonnade. The hippodrome at his
Tuscan seat, for riding exercise, is formed by lines of box and
laurel and cypress and plane tree. The fig and mulberry
form a garden at the Laurentine villa.<a id="noteref_1026" name="noteref_1026" href="#note_1026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1026</span></span></a> The cultivated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>flowers are few, only roses and violets. But the Romans made
up for variety by lavish profusion. In the Neronian orgies a
fortune was sometimes spent on Egyptian roses for a single
banquet.<a id="noteref_1027" name="noteref_1027" href="#note_1027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1027</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We might almost conjecture how the days passed amid
such scenes, even without any formal diary. But Pliny has
left us two descriptions of a gentleman’s day in the country.<a id="noteref_1028" name="noteref_1028" href="#note_1028"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1028</span></span></a>
Pliny himself, as we might expect, awoke early, about six
o’clock, and in one of those sleeping-rooms, so carefully shut
off from the voices of nature or from household noise, with
shutters still closed, he meditated some literary piece. Then,
calling for his amanuensis, he dictated what he had composed.
About ten or eleven, he passed into a shady cloister, opening
on a bed of violets, or a grove of plane trees, where he
continued his literary work. Then followed a drive, during
which, according to his uncle’s precept and example, his
studies were still continued.<a id="noteref_1029" name="noteref_1029" href="#note_1029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1029</span></span></a> A short siesta, a walk, declamation
in Greek and Latin, after the habit of Cicero, gymnastic
exercise, and the bath, filled the space till dinner time arrived.
During this meal, a book was read aloud, and the evening
hours were enlivened by acting or music and the society of
friends. Occasional hunting and the cares of a rural estate
came in to vary this routine. The round of Spurinna’s day,
which excited Pliny’s admiration by its rigid regularity, is
pretty much the same as his own, except that Spurinna
seems to have talked more and read less.<a id="noteref_1030" name="noteref_1030" href="#note_1030"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1030</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the ordinary English squire Pliny’s studious life in the
country would not seem very attractive. And his pretence
of sport was probably ridiculed even in his own day.<a id="noteref_1031" name="noteref_1031" href="#note_1031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1031</span></span></a> But
his Letters give glimpses of a rural society which, both in its
pleasures and its cares, has probably been always much the
same from one age to another in Europe. On his way to
Como, Pliny once turned aside for a couple of days to his
Tuscan estate, to join in the dedication of a temple which he
had built for the people of Tifernum Tiberinum. The consecration
was to be followed by a dinner to his good neighbours,
who had elected him patron of their township, who were
very proud of his career, and greeted him warmly whenever
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he came among them.<a id="noteref_1032" name="noteref_1032" href="#note_1032"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1032</span></span></a> There is also the record of the restoration,
in obedience to the warning of a diviner, of an ancient
temple of Ceres on his lands, with colonnades to shelter the
worshippers who frequented the shrine. And the venerable
wooden statue of the goddess, which was much decayed, had
to be replaced by a more artistic image. But the life of a
Roman proprietor, of course, had its prosaic and troublesome
side which Pliny does not conceal. There is an interesting
letter in which he consults a friend on the question of the
purchase of an estate.<a id="noteref_1033" name="noteref_1033" href="#note_1033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1033</span></span></a> It adjoined, or rather cut into his
own lands. It could be managed by the same bailiff, and
the same staff of labourers and artisans would serve for both
estates. On the other hand, Pliny thinks, it is better not
to put too many eggs into one basket. It is more prudent
to have estates widely dispersed, and thus less exposed to a
single stroke of calamity. Moreover this estate, however
tempting, with its fertile, well-watered meadows, its vineyards
and woods, is burdened by an insolvent tenantry, who, through
faulty management, have been allowed to fall into arrear.
Pliny, however, is tempted to buy at a greatly reduced price,<a id="noteref_1034" name="noteref_1034" href="#note_1034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1034</span></span></a>
and, in order to meet the payment, although his wealth is
nearly all in land, he can call in some loans at interest, and
the balance can be borrowed from his father-in-law, whose
purse is always at his disposal. Pliny was sometimes worried
by the complaints of the people on his estates, and finds it
very difficult to secure solvent tenants on a five years lease.
He made liberal remissions of rent, but arrears went on
accumulating, until the tenant in despair gave up any attempt
to repay his debt. In this extremity, Pliny resolved to adopt
a different system of letting. He substituted for a fixed rent
a certain proportion of the produce,<a id="noteref_1035" name="noteref_1035" href="#note_1035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1035</span></span></a> in fact the métayer
system, and employed some of his people to see that the
returns were not fraudulently diminished. At another time
he is embarrassed by finding that, owing to a bad vintage,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the men who have bought his grapes in advance are going to
be heavy losers. He makes a uniform remission to all of
about twelve per cent. But he gives an additional advantage to
the large buyers, and to those who had been prompt in their
payments.<a id="noteref_1036" name="noteref_1036" href="#note_1036"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1036</span></span></a> It is characteristic of the man that he says, quite
naturally, that the landlord should share with his tenant such
risks from the fickleness of nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So good a man was sure to be far more afflicted by the
troubles of his dependents than by any pecuniary losses of his
own. One year, there were many deaths among his slaves.
Pliny feels this acutely, but he consoles himself by the reflection
that he has been liberal in manumission, and still more liberal in
allowing his slaves to make their wills, the validity of which he
maintains as if they were legal instruments.<a id="noteref_1037" name="noteref_1037" href="#note_1037"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1037</span></span></a> If Pliny shows
a little too much self-complacency in this human sympathy,
there can be no doubt that, like Seneca, he felt that slaves
were humble friends, men of the same flesh and blood as the
master, and that the master has a moral duty towards them,
quite apart from the legal conventions of Rome.<a id="noteref_1038" name="noteref_1038" href="#note_1038"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1038</span></span></a> When his
wife’s grandfather proposed to make numerous manumissions,
Pliny rejoiced greatly at the accession of so many new citizens
to the municipality.<a id="noteref_1039" name="noteref_1039" href="#note_1039"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1039</span></span></a> When his favourite reader, Encolpius,
was seized with hemorrhage, Pliny displayed a genuine and most
affectionate concern for the humble partner of his studies.<a id="noteref_1040" name="noteref_1040" href="#note_1040"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1040</span></span></a>
Another member of his household, a freedman named Zosimus,
suffered from the same malady. Zosimus seems to have
been a most excellent, loyal, and accomplished man. He was
very versatile, a comedian, a musician, a tasteful reader of
every kind of literature.<a id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041" href="#note_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a> His patron sent him to Egypt to
recruit his health. But, from putting too great a strain upon
his voice, he had a return of his dangerous illness, and once
more needed change of air. Pliny determined to send him to
the Riviera, and begs a friend, Paulinus, to let Zosimus have the
use of his villa and all necessary attention, for which Pliny will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bear the cost.<a id="noteref_1042" name="noteref_1042" href="#note_1042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1042</span></span></a> In his social relations with his freedmen Pliny
always shows himself the perfect, kindly gentleman. Juvenal
and Martial poured their scorn on those unequal dinners, where
the guests were graduated, and where poorer wine and coarser
viands were served out to those of humble degree.<a id="noteref_1043" name="noteref_1043" href="#note_1043"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1043</span></span></a> Pliny
was present at one of these entertainments, and he expresses
his contempt for the vulgar host in terms of unwonted energy.<a id="noteref_1044" name="noteref_1044" href="#note_1044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1044</span></span></a>
His own freedmen, as he tells a fellow-guest, are entertained as
equals at his table. If a man fears the expense, he can find a
remedy by restraining his own luxury, and sharing the plain
fare which he imposes on his company. Pliny’s relations
with his slaves and freedmen were very like those which the
kindly English squire cultivates towards his household and
dependents. The affectionate regret for a good master or
mistress, recorded on many an inscription of that age,<a id="noteref_1045" name="noteref_1045" href="#note_1045"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1045</span></span></a> shows
that Pliny’s household was by no means a rare exception.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet the Letters of Pliny, with all their charity and
tranquil optimism, reveal now and then a darker side of
household slavery. A man of praetorian rank named Largius
Macedo, who forgot, or perhaps too vividly remembered, his
own servile origin, was known as a cruel and haughty master.
While he was enjoying the bath in his Formian villa, he was
suddenly surrounded by a throng of angry slaves who, with
every expression of hatred and loathing, inflicted on him such
injuries that he was left for dead on the glowing pavement.
He seemed, or pretended for a while, to be dead. A few who
remained faithful took up the apparently lifeless corpse, amid
the shrieks of his concubines, and bore him into the Frigidarium.
The coolness and the clamour recalled him from his
swoon. The would-be murderers meanwhile had fled, but many
of them were caught in the end, and the outrage was sternly
avenged.<a id="noteref_1046" name="noteref_1046" href="#note_1046"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1046</span></span></a> In another letter, Pliny tells the tale of the
mysterious disappearance of one Metilius Crispus, a citizen
of Como, for whom Pliny had obtained equestrian rank, and
made him a gift of the required HS.400,000. Metilius set
out on a journey and was never heard of again.<a id="noteref_1047" name="noteref_1047" href="#note_1047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a> It is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>significant that of the slaves who attended him no one ever
reappeared. Amid such perils, says Pliny, do we masters live,
and no kindness can relieve us from alarm. Seneca remarks
that the master’s life is continually at the mercy of his slaves.<a id="noteref_1048" name="noteref_1048" href="#note_1048"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1048</span></span></a>
And the cruel stringency of legislation shows how real was the
peril.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny was only an infant in the evil days when suicide
was the one refuge from tyranny, when the lancet so often
opened the way to <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal freedom.”</span> Yet, even in his later
years, men not unfrequently escaped from intolerable calamity
or incurable disease by a voluntary death.<a id="noteref_1049" name="noteref_1049" href="#note_1049"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1049</span></span></a> The morality
of suicide was long a debated question. There were strict
moralists who maintained that it was never lawful to quit
one’s post before the final signal to retreat. Men like Seneca
regarded it as a question to be determined by circumstances
and motives.<a id="noteref_1050" name="noteref_1050" href="#note_1050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1050</span></span></a> He would not palliate wild, impetuous self-murder,
without a justifying cause. On the other hand, there
might be, especially under a monster like Nero, cases in which
it were mere folly not to choose an easy emancipation rather
than a certain death of torture and ignominy. Eternal law,
which has assigned a single entrance to this life, has mercifully
allowed us many exits. Any death is preferable to servitude.<a id="noteref_1051" name="noteref_1051" href="#note_1051"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1051</span></span></a>
So, in the case of disease and old age, it is merely a question
whether the remainder of life is worth living. If the mental
powers are falling into irreparable decay, if the malady is
tormenting and incurable, Seneca would permit the rational
soul to quit abruptly its crumbling tenement, not to escape
pain or weakness, but to shake off the slavery of a worthless
life.<a id="noteref_1052" name="noteref_1052" href="#note_1052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1052</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny was not a philosopher, and had no elaborate theory of
suicide or of anything else. But his opinion on the question
may be gathered from his remarks on the case of Titius Aristo,
the learned jurist. To rush on death, he says, is a vulgar,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>commonplace act. But to balance the various motives, and make
a deliberate and rational choice may, in certain circumstances,
be the proof of a lofty mind.<a id="noteref_1053" name="noteref_1053" href="#note_1053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1053</span></span></a> The cases of suicide described
in the Letters are nearly always cases of incurable or prolonged
disease. The best known is that of the luxurious Silius
Italicus, who starved himself to death in his seventy-fifth year.<a id="noteref_1054" name="noteref_1054" href="#note_1054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1054</span></span></a>
He was afflicted with an incurable tumour, almost the only
trouble in his long and happy life. Corellius Rufus, who had
watched over Pliny’s career with almost parental care,<a id="noteref_1055" name="noteref_1055" href="#note_1055"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1055</span></span></a> chose
to end his life in a similar manner. Pliny was immensely
saddened by the close of a life which seemed to enjoy so many
blessings, high character, great reputation and influence, family
love and friendship. Yet he does not question the last resolve
of Corellius. In his thirty-third year he had been seized with
hereditary gout. During the period of vigorous manhood, he
had warded off its onsets by an extreme abstinence. But as
old age crept on, its tortures, wracking every limb, became
unendurable, and Corellius determined to put an end to the
hopeless struggle. His obstinacy was proof against all the
entreaties of his wife and friends, and Pliny, who was called
in as a last resource, came only to hear the physician repelled
for the last time with a single energetic word.<a id="noteref_1056" name="noteref_1056" href="#note_1056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1056</span></span></a> Sailing once
on Lake Como, Pliny heard from an old friend the tragic tale
of a double suicide from a verandah overhanging the lake.
The husband had long suffered from a loathsome and hopeless
malady. His wife insisted on knowing the truth, and, when
it was revealed to her, she nerved him to end the cruel ordeal,
and promised to bear him company. Bound together, the pair
took the fatal leap.<a id="noteref_1057" name="noteref_1057" href="#note_1057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1057</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In spite of his charity and optimism,<a id="noteref_1058" name="noteref_1058" href="#note_1058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1058</span></span></a> it would not be altogether
true to say that Pliny was blind to the faults and vices
of his time. He speaks, with almost Tacitean scorn, of the
rewards which awaited a calculating childlessness, and of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>eager servility of the will-hunter.<a id="noteref_1059" name="noteref_1059" href="#note_1059"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1059</span></span></a> In recommending a tutor for
the son of Corellia Hispulla, he regards the teacher’s stainless
character as of paramount importance in an age of dangerous
licence, when youth was beset with manifold seductions.<a id="noteref_1060" name="noteref_1060" href="#note_1060"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1060</span></span></a> He
blushes for the degradation of senatorial character displayed in
the scurrilous or obscene entries which were sometimes found on
the voting tablets of the august body.<a id="noteref_1061" name="noteref_1061" href="#note_1061"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1061</span></span></a> The decline of modesty
and courteous deference in the young towards their elders
greatly afflicted so courteous a gentleman. There seemed to be
no respect left for age or authority. With their fancied omniscience
and intuitive wisdom, young men disdain to learn from
any one or to imitate any example; they are their own models.<a id="noteref_1062" name="noteref_1062" href="#note_1062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1062</span></span></a>
Among the many spotless and charming women of Pliny’s
circle, there is one curious exception, one, we may venture to
surmise, who had been formed in the Neronian age. Ummidia
Quadratilla was a lady of the highest rank, who died at the age
of eighty in the middle of the reign of Trajan.<a id="noteref_1063" name="noteref_1063" href="#note_1063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1063</span></span></a> She preserved
to the end an extraordinary health and vigour, and evidently
enjoyed the external side of life with all the zest of the old
days of licence in her youth. Her grandson, who lived under
her roof, was one of Pliny’s dearest friends, a spotless and
almost puritanical character. Ummidia, even in her old age,
kept a troop of pantomimic artistes, and continued to enjoy
their doubtful exhibitions. But her grandson would never
witness them, and, it must be said, Ummidia respected and
even encouraged a virtue superior to her own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been remarked that, in nearly all these cases, where
Pliny has any fault to find with his generation, the evil seems
to be only a foil for the virtue of some of his friends. Even in
his own day, there were those who criticised him for his extravagant
praise of the people he loved. He takes the censure
as a compliment, preferring the kind-heartedness which is
occasionally deceived, to the cold critical habit which has
lost all illusions.<a id="noteref_1064" name="noteref_1064" href="#note_1064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1064</span></span></a> Pliny belonged to a caste who were linked
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to one another by the strongest ties of loyalty and tradition.<a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a>
The members of it were bound to support one another by
counsel, encouragement, and influence, they were expected
to help a comrade’s advancement in the career of honours, to
applaud and stimulate his literary ambition, to be prodigal of
sympathy or congratulation or pecuniary help in all the vicissitudes
of public or private life.<a id="noteref_1066" name="noteref_1066" href="#note_1066"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1066</span></span></a> The older men, who had borne
the weight of great affairs, recognised the duty of forming the
character of their juniors by precept and criticism. In this
fashion the old soldier Spurinna, on his morning drive, would
pour forth to some young companion the wealth of his long experience.
In this spirit Verginius Rufus and Corellius stood by
Pliny throughout his official career, to guide and support him.<a id="noteref_1067" name="noteref_1067" href="#note_1067"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1067</span></span></a>
Pliny, in his turn, was always lavish of this kind of help, and
deemed it a matter of pride and duty to afford it. Sometimes
he solicits office for a friend’s son, or commends a man to the
emperor for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jus trium liberorum</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1068" name="noteref_1068" href="#note_1068"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1068</span></span></a> Sometimes he applauds
the early efforts of a young pleader at the bar, or gives him
counsel as to the causes which he should undertake, or the
discipline necessary for oratorical success.<a id="noteref_1069" name="noteref_1069" href="#note_1069"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1069</span></span></a> He was often consulted
about the choice of a tutor for boys, and he responded
with all the earnestness of a man who believed in the infinite
importance of sound influence in the early years of life.<a id="noteref_1070" name="noteref_1070" href="#note_1070"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1070</span></span></a> To
his older friends he would address disquisitions on style, consolations
in bereavement, congratulations on official preferment,
descriptions of some fair scene or picturesque incident in rural
life. He often wrote, like Symmachus, merely to maintain
the connection of friendly sympathy by a chat on paper. His
vanity is only too evident in some of these letters. But it is,
after all, an innocent vanity and the consuming anxiety to
cherish the warmth and solidarity of friendship, and a high
tone in the great class to which he belonged, might well cover
even graver faults. If there was too much self-indulgence in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that class, if they often abandoned themselves to the seductions
of ease and literary trifling in luxurious retreats, it is also to
be remembered that a man of rank paid heavily for his place
in Roman society, both in money and in the observance of a
very exacting social code. And no one recognised the obligation
with more cheerful alacrity than Pliny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pliny felt a genuine anxiety that young men of birth should
aim at personal distinction. Any gleam of generous ambition,
any sign of strenuous energy, which might save a young
aristocrat from the temptations of ease and wealth, were hailed
by him with unaffected delight. He was evidently very susceptible
to the charm of manner which youths of this class
often possess. When to that was added strength of character,
his satisfaction was complete. Hence his delight when Fuscus
Salinator and Ummidius Quadratus, of the very cream of
the Roman nobility, entered on the conflicts of the Centumviral
Court.<a id="noteref_1071" name="noteref_1071" href="#note_1071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a> And indeed these young men appear to have
had many graces and virtues. Salinator, in particular, with
exquisite literary culture, had a mingled charm of boyish
simplicity, gravity, and sweetness.<a id="noteref_1072" name="noteref_1072" href="#note_1072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1072</span></span></a> Asinius Bassus, the son
of Asinius Rufus, was another of this promising band of youth,
blameless, learned, and diligent, whom Pliny commends for the
quaestorship to Fundanus, then apparently designated as consul.<a id="noteref_1073" name="noteref_1073" href="#note_1073"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1073</span></span></a>
There is no more genuine feeling in the Letters than the grief
of Pliny for the early death of Junius Avitus, another youth
of high promise. Pliny had formed his character, and supported
him in his candidature for office. He had helped him
with advice in his studies, or in his administrative duties.
Avitus repaid all this paternal care by a docility and deference
which were becoming rare among the young men of the day.
Winning the affection and confidence of his elders in the
service, Avitus was surely destined to develop into one of those
just and strenuous imperial officers, like Corbulo or Verginius
Rufus, many of whom have left only a name on a brief inscription,
but who were the glory and strength of the Empire
in the times of its deepest degradation. But all such hopes for
Avitus were extinguished in a day.

The upright and virtuous men of Pliny’s circle, Corellius

often been used to refute the pessimism of Juvenal. We have
in a former chapter seen reason to believe that the satirist’s
view of female character needs to be similarly rectified. Even
in the worst reigns the pages of Tacitus reveal to us strong
and pure women, both in the palace and in great senatorial
houses. In the wide philosophic class there was probably
many an Arria and Plotina. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agricola</span></span>, and in Seneca’s
letters to Marcia and Helvia, we can see that, even at the
darkest hour, there were homes with an atmosphere of old
Roman self-restraint and sobriety, where good women wielded
a powerful influence over their husbands and their sons,
and where the examples of the old Republic were used,
as Biblical characters with us, to fortify virtue.<a id="noteref_1074" name="noteref_1074" href="#note_1074"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1074</span></span></a> Seneca, in
his views about women, as in many other things, is essentially
modern. He admires indeed the antique ideal of self-contained
strength and homely virtue. But he also believes
in the equal capacity of women for culture, even in the field of
philosophy, and he half regrets that an old-fashioned prejudice
had debarred Helvia from receiving a philosophic discipline.<a id="noteref_1075" name="noteref_1075" href="#note_1075"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1075</span></span></a>
Tacitus and Pliny, who had no great faith in philosophy as a
study for men, would hardly have recommended it for women.
But they lived among women who were cultivated in the
best sense. Pliny’s third wife, Calpurnia, was able to give
him the fullest sympathy in his literary efforts.<a id="noteref_1076" name="noteref_1076" href="#note_1076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1076</span></span></a> But her
fame, of which she probably little dreamt, is founded on her
purity and sweetness of character. Her ancestors, like Pliny’s,
belonged to the aristocracy of Como. Her aunt, Calpurnia
Hispulla, who was a dear friend of Pliny’s mother, had watched
over her during the years of girlhood with a sedulous care
which made her an ideal wife. What Calpurnia was like as a
girl, we may probably picture to ourselves from the prose elegy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Pliny on the death of the young daughter of Minutius
Fundanus.<a id="noteref_1077" name="noteref_1077" href="#note_1077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1077</span></span></a> It is the picture of a beautiful character, and a
fair young life cut off too soon. The girl had not yet reached
her fourteenth year. She was already betrothed when she
was seized with a fatal sickness. Her sweet girlish modesty,
which was combined with a matronly gravity, charmed all her
father’s friends. She had love for all the household, her tutors
and slaves, nurses and maids. A vigorous mind triumphed
over bodily weakness, and she passed through her last illness
with a sweet patience, encouraging her father and sister to
bear up, and showing no shrinking from death.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although we know of a good many happy wedded lives in
that age,<a id="noteref_1078" name="noteref_1078" href="#note_1078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a> there is no picture so full of pure devotion and tenderness
as that which we have in Pliny’s letters to Calpurnia. They
are love-letters in the best sense and the most perfect style.<a id="noteref_1079" name="noteref_1079" href="#note_1079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1079</span></span></a>
Pliny’s youth was long past when he won the hand of Calpurnia,
yet their love for one another is that of boy and girl. When
she has to go into Campania for her health, he is racked with
all sorts of anxiety about her, and entreats her to write once,
or even twice, a day. Pliny reads her letters over and over
again, as if they had just come. He has her image before him
by night, and at the wonted hour by day his feet carry him to
her vacant room. His only respite from these pains of a lover
is while he is engaged in court. Pliny had frequent care about
Calpurnia’s health. They did not belong to the hideous class
who preferred <span class="tei tei-q">“the rewards of childlessness,”</span> but their hopes
of offspring were dashed again and again. These griefs were
imparted to Calpurnia’s aunt, and to her grandfather, Calpurnius
Fabatus, a generous old squire of Como, who was as anxious as
Pliny to have descendants of his race. At the time of the old
man’s death, Calpurnia was with her husband in Bithynia, and
she wished to hasten home at once to console her aunt. Pliny,
not having time to secure the emperor’s sanction, gave her
the official order for the use of the public post on her journey
back to Italy. In answer to his letter of explanation and
excuse, Trajan sent his approval in his usual kind and
courteous style. This is the last glimpse we have of Pliny
and Calpurnia.<a id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a>

Pliny’s character, as displayed in his Letters, is the embodiment
of the finest moral tone of the great age which had
opened when he died, in kindlier or juster treatment of the
slave, in high respect for women, in conscientious care for the
education of the young, in beneficent provision for the helpless
and distressed. But it would be a mistaken view to regard
these ideas as an altogether new departure. It is dangerous
to assert that anything is altogether new in Roman social
history. The truth is that the moral sentiment in which these
movements took their rise had been for generations in the air.
It was diffused by the Stoic preaching of the brotherhood and
equality of men as fellow-citizens of one great commonwealth.
The duty of redeeming the captive and succouring the poor
had been preached by Cicero a century and a half before Pliny’s
Letters appeared.<a id="noteref_1081" name="noteref_1081" href="#note_1081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1081</span></span></a> Horace had, a few years later, asked the

an evangelist, all the doctrines on which the humane legislation

slave to kindness and consideration.<a id="noteref_1083" name="noteref_1083" href="#note_1083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1083</span></span></a> He brands in many

Behind all his bitter pessimism there is a pure and lofty moral

slight negligence is of the same elements as we are.<a id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086" href="#note_1086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> The

It is by her command that we mourn the calamity of a friend
or the death of the babe <span class="tei tei-q">“too small for the funeral pyre.”</span> The
scenes of suffering and pity which the satirist has sketched in
some tender lines were assuredly not imaginary pictures. We are
apt to forget, in our modern self-complacency, that, at least among
civilised races, human nature in its broad features remains
pretty much the same from age to age. On an obscure epitaph
of this period you may read the words—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bene fac, hoc tecum

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The duties of wealth, both in Greece and Rome, were at
all times rigorously enforced by public opinion. The rich had
to pay heavily for their honours and social consideration in
the days of Cicero, and in the days of Symmachus, as they
had in the days of Pericles.<a id="noteref_1091" name="noteref_1091" href="#note_1091"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1091</span></span></a> They had to contribute to the
amusement of the people, and to support a crowd of clients
and freedmen. In the remotest municipality, the same
ambitions and the same social demands, as we shall show
in the next chapter, put an enormous strain on the resources
of the upper class. Men must have often ruined themselves
by this profuse liberality. In the reign of Augustus a great
patron had several times given a favourite freedman sums of
£3000 or £4000. The patron’s descendant in the reign of
Nero had to become a pensioner of the emperor. Juvenal and
Martial reveal the clamorous demands by which the great
patron was assailed.<a id="noteref_1092" name="noteref_1092" href="#note_1092"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1092</span></span></a> The motives for this generosity of the
wealthy class were at all times mixed and various. But in
our period, the growth of a pure humane charity is unmistakable,
of a feeling of duty to the helpless, whether
young or old. The State had from the time of the Gracchi
taken upon itself the immense burden of providing food for a
quarter of a million of the proletariat of Rome. But in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>days of Pliny it recognised fresh obligations. The importance
of education and the growth of poverty appealed powerfully
to a ruling class, which, under the influence of philosophy, was
coming to believe more and more in the duty of benevolence
and of devotion to things of the mind. All the emperors
from Vespasian to M. Aurelius made liberal provision for the
higher studies.<a id="noteref_1093" name="noteref_1093" href="#note_1093"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1093</span></span></a> But this endowment of culture, which in
the end did harm as well as good, is not so interesting to us
as the charitable foundations for the children of the poor.
It was apparently the emperor Nerva, the rigid economist
who sold the imperial furniture and jewels to replenish the
treasury,<a id="noteref_1094" name="noteref_1094" href="#note_1094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1094</span></span></a> who first made provision for the children of needy
parents throughout Italy. But epigraphy tells us more than
literary history of the charity of the emperors. The tablet of
Veleia is a priceless record of the charitable measures adopted
by Trajan. The motive of the great emperor was probably,
as his panegyrist suggests, political as much as benevolent.<a id="noteref_1095" name="noteref_1095" href="#note_1095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a>
He may have wished to encourage the rearing of children who
should serve in the armies of the State, as well as to relieve
distress. The provision was even more evidently intended to
stimulate agriculture. The landed proprietors of the place, to
the number of forty-six, received on mortgage a loan from the
State of about £10,000 in our money, at an interest of five per
cent, which was less than half the usual rate of that time.<a id="noteref_1096" name="noteref_1096" href="#note_1096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1096</span></span></a>
The interest was appropriated to the maintenance of 300
poor children, at the rate of about £1:11s. a year for
each male child, and £1 for each girl. The illegitimate
children, who, it may be noted, were only two or three out of
so many, received a smaller allowance. The boys were supported
till their eighteenth year, the girls till fourteen. It
was a bold and sagacious attempt to encourage Italian agriculture,
to check the ominous depopulation of Italy,<a id="noteref_1097" name="noteref_1097" href="#note_1097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1097</span></span></a> and to
answer the cry of the poor. Hadrian continued and even
added to the benefaction of Trajan.<a id="noteref_1098" name="noteref_1098" href="#note_1098"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1098</span></span></a> Antoninus Pius, in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, while the emperors were responding to the call of
charity by using the resources of the State, it is clear, from
the Letters of Pliny and from the inscriptions, that private
benevolence was even more active. Pliny has a conception
of the uses and responsibilities of wealth which, in spite of
the teaching of Galilee, is not yet very common. Although
he was not a very wealthy man, he acted up to his principles
on a scale and proportion which only a few of our millionaires
have yet reached. The lavish generosity of Pliny is a
commonplace of social history. We have not the slightest
wish to detract from the merited fame of that kindliest of
Roman gentlemen. But a survey of the inscriptions may
incline the inquirer to believe that, according to their means,
there were many men and women in obscure municipalities
all over the world, who were as generous and public-spirited
as Pliny.<a id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a> With Pliny, as with those more obscure benefactors,
the impelling motive was love for the parent city or
the village which was the home of their race, and where the
years of youth had been passed. Pliny, the distinguished
advocate, the famous man of letters, the darling of Roman
society, still remained the loyal son of Como, from which his
love never strays.<a id="noteref_1102" name="noteref_1102" href="#note_1102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1102</span></span></a> He followed and improved upon the
example of his father in munificence to his native place.<a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href="#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a>
He had little liking for games and gladiatorial shows, which
were the most popular objects of liberality in those days. But
he gave a sum of nearly £9000 for the foundation of a town
library, with an annual endowment of more than £800 to
maintain it.<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104" href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a> Finding that promising youths of Como had
to resort to Milan for their higher education, he offered to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>contribute one-third of the expense of a high school at Como,
if the parents would raise the remainder. The letter which
records the offer shows Pliny at his best, wise and thoughtful
as well as generous.<a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105" href="#note_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a> He wishes to keep boys under the
protection of home influence, to make them lovers of their
mother city; and he limits his benefaction in order to
stimulate the interest of the parents in the cause of education,
and in the appointment of the teachers. Another sum of
between £4000 and £5000 he gave to Como for the support
of boys and girls of the poorer class.<a id="noteref_1106" name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a> He also left more than
£4000 for public baths, and a sum of nearly £16,000 to
his freedmen, and for communal feasts. On two of his estates
he built or repaired temples at his own expense.<a id="noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107" href="#note_1107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> His private
benefactions were on a similar scale. It is not necessary to
adopt the cynical conclusion that Pliny has told us all his
liberality. The kindly delicacy with which Pliny claims the
right of a second father to make up the dowry of the daughter
of his friend Quintilian, might surely save him from such an
imputation.<a id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108" href="#note_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a> In the same spirit he offers to Romatius Firmus
the £2500 which was needed to raise his fortune to the level
of equestrian rank.<a id="noteref_1109" name="noteref_1109" href="#note_1109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1109</span></span></a> When the philosophers were banished by
Domitian, Pliny, who was then praetor, at the most imminent
risk visited his friend Artemidorus, and lent him, free of
interest, a considerable sum of money.<a id="noteref_1110" name="noteref_1110" href="#note_1110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1110</span></span></a> The daughter of one of

all the debts and left Calvina with an inheritance free from
all burdens.<a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href="#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a> He gave his old nurse a little estate which cost

which might shame a modern testator with ten times his
fortune, is not so striking as the kindness which prompted
them, and the modest delicacy with which they were made.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet Pliny, as we have said, is only a shining example of a
numerous class of more obscure benefactors. For a thousand
who know his Letters, there are few who have read the stone
records of similar generosity. Yet these memorials abound for
those who care to read them. And any one who will spend a
few days, or even a few well-directed hours, in examining the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>inscriptions of the early Empire, will find many a common, self-complacent
prejudice melting away. He will discover a profusion
of generosity to add to the beauty, dignity, or convenience
of the parent city, to lighten the dulness of ordinary life, to bring
all ranks together in common scenes of enjoyment, to relieve want
and suffering among the indigent. The motives of this extraordinary
liberality were indeed often mixed, and it was, from
our point of view, often misdirected. The gifts were sometimes
made merely to win popularity, or to repay civic honours
which had been conferred by the populace. They were too
often devoted to gladiatorial shows and other exhibitions which
only debased the spectators. Yet the greatest part of them
were expended on objects of public utility—baths, theatres,
markets, or new roads and aqueducts, or on those public
banquets which knitted all ranks together. There was in
those days an immense <span class="tei tei-q">“civic ardour,”</span> an almost passionate
rivalry, to make the mother city a more pleasant and a more
splendid home. The endless foundations for civic feasts to
all orders, in which even children and slaves were not forgotten,
with a distribution of money at the close, softened the
sharp distinctions of rank, and gave an appreciable relief to
poverty. Other foundations were more definitely inspired by
charity and pity. In remote country towns, there were pious
founders who, like Pliny and Trajan, and the Antonines, provided
for the nurture of the children of the poor. Bequests
were left to cheapen the main necessaries of life.<a id="noteref_1113" name="noteref_1113" href="#note_1113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a> Nor were
the aged and the sick forgotten. In Lorium, near the old
home of the Antonines, a humble spice dealer provided in his
will for a free distribution of medicines to the poor people of
the town.<a id="noteref_1114" name="noteref_1114" href="#note_1114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1114</span></span></a> The countless gifts and legacies to the colleges,
which were the refuge of the poor in that age, in every region
of the Roman world, are an irresistible proof of an overflowing
charity. Pliny’s love of the quiet town where his infancy
was passed, and the record of a like patriotism or benevolence
in so many others, draw us on to the study of that free and
generous municipal life which was the great glory of the
Antonine age.

Nearly all the intimate friends of Pliny were, like himself, bred
in the country, and, as we have seen, he has left us a priceless
picture of that rural aristocracy in the calm refinement of
their country seats. But of the ordinary life of the provincial
town we learn very little from Pliny. Indeed, the silence
of Roman literature generally as to social life outside the
capital is very remarkable.<a id="noteref_1115" name="noteref_1115" href="#note_1115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1115</span></span></a> In the long line of great Latin
authors from Ennius to Juvenal, there is hardly one whose
native place was Rome. The men who are the glory of
Roman letters in epic and lyric poetry, in oratory and
history, in comedy and satire, were born in quiet country towns
in Italy or the remoter provinces. But the reminiscences of
the scenes of their infancy will generally be found to be faint
and rare. Horace, indeed, displays a tender piety for that

This silence of the literary class is not due to any want of
love in the Roman for the calm and freshness and haunting
charm of country scenes, still less to callousness towards old
associations. Certainly Virgil cannot be charged with any
such lack of sensibility. In the Eclogues and the Georgics,
the memory of the old farm at Andes breaks through the
more conventional sentiment of Alexandrian tradition. In
the scenery of these poems, there are <span class="tei tei-q">“mossy fountains and
grass softer than sleep,”</span> the hues of violet, poppy, and hyacinth,
the shade of ancient ilex, and the yellow wealth of cornfield.
We hear the murmur of bees, <span class="tei tei-q">“the moan of doves in immemorial
elms,”</span> the rush of the river, the whispering of the
wind. The pastoral charm of the midsummer prime is
there, from the freshness of fields under the morning
star, through the hours alive with the song of the cicala
and the lowing of the herds around the pool, through the
still, hot, vacant noontide, till the moonbeams are glinting
on the dewy grasses of the glades.<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href="#note_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a> Nor can any lover
of Virgil ever forget the fire of old sentiment in the
muster of Italian chivalry in the seventh book of the
Aeneid.<a id="noteref_1120" name="noteref_1120" href="#note_1120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1120</span></span></a> Tibur and Praeneste, Anagnia, Nomentum, and
Amiternum, and many another old Sabine town, which send
forth their young warriors to the fray, are each stamped
on the imagination by some grace of natural beauty, or some
glory of ancient legend. In the Flavian period, as we have
seen, the great nobles had their villas on every pleasant
site, wherever sea or hill or woodland offered a fair prospect
and genial air. To these scenes they hastened, like emancipated
schoolboys, when the dog-days set in. They had a genuine
love of the unspoilt countryside, with its simple natural
pleasures, its husbandry of the olden time, its joyous plenty,
above all its careless freedom and repose.<a id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121" href="#note_1121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1121</span></span></a> The great charm
of a rural retreat was its distance from the <span class="tei tei-q">“noise and smoke
and wealth”</span> of Rome. The escape from the penalties of fame,
from the boredom of interminable dinners, the intrusive importunity
of curious busybodies, the malice of jealous rivals,
gives a fresh zest to the long tranquil days under the ilex
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shade among the Sabine hills.<a id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122" href="#note_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a> Horace probably felt more
keenly than Juvenal the charm of hill and stream and the
scenes of rustic toils and gaiety. Yet the exquisite good
sense of Horace would have recoiled from the declamatory
extravagance with which Juvenal justifies his friend’s
retirement from the capital, by a realistic picture of all
its sordid troubles and vices and absurdities.<a id="noteref_1123" name="noteref_1123" href="#note_1123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1123</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“To love
Rome at Tibur and Tibur at Rome”</span> was the expression
of the educated Roman’s feelings in a form which he would
have recognised to be as just as it was happy. In spite of
the charm of the country, to any real man of letters
or affairs, the fascination of Rome was irresistible. Pliny,
and no doubt hundreds of his class, from Augustus to
Theodosius, grumbled at the wasteful fashion in which their
lives were frittered away by monotonous social duties, as
imperious as they were generally vain.<a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href="#note_1124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1124</span></span></a> Yet to Pliny, as to
Symmachus, the prospect of never again seeing the city, so
seductive and so wearying, would have been absolutely intolerable.
Martial, when he retired to Bilbilis, seems to pity his
friend Juvenal, wandering restlessly through the noisy Suburra,
or climbing the Caelian in hot haste, to hang on the outskirts of
a levee.<a id="noteref_1125" name="noteref_1125" href="#note_1125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1125</span></span></a> Yet in the preface to this last book, Martial seems
to feel his banishment as keenly as Ovid felt his among the
frozen rivers of Scythia.<a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a> He misses in the <span class="tei tei-q">“provincial
solitude”</span> the sympathetic public which was eager for his
latest epigram, the fine critical judgment to appreciate, the
concourse of elegant idlers to supply the matter for his verses.<a id="noteref_1127" name="noteref_1127" href="#note_1127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1127</span></span></a>
And worst of all, the most famous wit of Rome is now the
mark for the ignorant spite and envy of a provincial clique.
Martial evidently feels very much as Dr. Johnson would have
felt if he had been compelled to live out his days in Skye.
Juvenal may affect to regret the simple ways of those rustic
places, where on festal days in the grass-grown theatre the
infant in his mother’s arms shudders at the awful masks of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the actors, and the aediles take their places in white tunics
like the humble crowd.<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a> But, in spite of this sentiment, the
true Roman had a certain contempt for municipal life,<a id="noteref_1129" name="noteref_1129" href="#note_1129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1129</span></span></a> for
the narrow range of its interests, the ludicrous assumption of
dignity by its petty magistrates, and its provincialisms.<a id="noteref_1130" name="noteref_1130" href="#note_1130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1130</span></span></a> It was
indeed only natural that the splendour and the vivid energy
of life in the capital of the world should throw provincial
life into the shade. Yet we can realise now, as a Roman
wit or man of fashion could hardly do, that the municipal
system, which had overspread the world from the Solway
to the edge of the Sahara, was not the least glory of the
Antonine age. And in any attempt to estimate the moral
condition of the masses in that age, the influence of municipal
life should occupy a large place.

It is beyond the scope of this work to trace provincial
towns through all their various grades, and their evolution in
the hands of Roman statesmanship from the time of Augustus.
What we are chiefly concerned with is the spirit and the rapid
development of that brilliant civic life, which not only covered
the worlds both of East and West with material monuments of
Roman energy, but profoundly influenced for good, or sometimes
for evil, the popular character. The magical transformation
wrought by Roman rule in a century and a half seized the
imagination of contemporaries such as the rhetor Aristides. And
the mere wreck of that brilliant civilisation which now meets
the traveller’s eye, in regions that have long returned to waste,
will not permit us to treat his eulogy of Rome as only a piece
of rhetoric. Regions, once desert solitudes, are thickly dotted
with flourishing cities; the Empire is a realm of cities. The
world has laid the sword aside, and keeps universal festival,
with all pomp and gladness. All other feuds and rivalries are
gone, and cities now vie with one another only in their splendour
and their pleasures. Every space is crowded with
porticoes, gymnasia, temple fronts, with studios and schools.<a id="noteref_1131" name="noteref_1131" href="#note_1131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1131</span></span></a>

This glowing description of the Roman world of the
Antonine age is not perhaps strengthened by the appeal to the
doubtful statistics of other contemporaries, such as Aelian and
Josephus. We may hesitate to accept the statement that Italy
had once 1197 cities, or that Gaul possessed 1200.<a id="noteref_1133" name="noteref_1133" href="#note_1133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1133</span></span></a> In these
estimates, if they have any solid foundation, the term <span class="tei tei-q">“city”</span>
must be taken in a very elastic sense. But there are other
more trustworthy reckonings which sufficiently support the
glowing description of Aristides. When the Romans conquered
Spain and Gaul, they found a system of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pagi</span></span> or cantons,
with very few considerable towns. The 800 towns which
are said to have been taken by Julius Caesar can have been
little more than villages. But the Romanisation of both
countries meant centralisation. Where the Romans did not
find towns they created them.<a id="noteref_1134" name="noteref_1134" href="#note_1134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1134</span></span></a> Gradually, but rapidly, the
isolated rural life became more social and urban. In the
north-eastern province of Spain, out of 293 communities in the
time of the elder Pliny, 179 were in some sense urban, 114
were still purely rustic;<a id="noteref_1135" name="noteref_1135" href="#note_1135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1135</span></span></a> and we may be sure that this is an
immense advance on the condition of the country at the time
of the conquest. In the reign of Antoninus Pius, only 27 of
these rural districts remained without an organised civic centre.<a id="noteref_1136" name="noteref_1136" href="#note_1136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1136</span></span></a>
In Gaul, Julius Caesar impressed the stamp of Rome on the
province of Narbo, by founding cities of the Roman type, and
his policy was continued by Augustus. The loose cantonal
system almost disappeared from the province in the south,
although it lingered long in the northern regions of Gaul. Yet
even in the north, on the borders of Germany, Cologne, from
the reign of Claudius, became the envy of the barbarians across
the Rhine,<a id="noteref_1137" name="noteref_1137" href="#note_1137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1137</span></span></a> and Trèves, from the days of Augustus, already

Perhaps nowhere, however, had the <span class="tei tei-q">“Roman peace”</span> worked
greater miracles of civic prosperity than in North Africa.
That the population of Roman Africa was in the period of

a total of 297.<a id="noteref_1148" name="noteref_1148" href="#note_1148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1148</span></span></a> The remains of more than 20 amphitheatres

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>those capitols, forums, aqueducts, and temples in what are now
sandy solitudes, not even occupied by a native village. In
the province of Numidia, within a few leagues of the Sahara,
the Roman colony of Thamugadi (Timgad) was founded, as an
inscription tells, by Trajan in the year 100.<a id="noteref_1149" name="noteref_1149" href="#note_1149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1149</span></span></a> There, in what
is now a scene of utter loneliness and desolation, the remains
of a busy and well-organised community have been brought to
light by French explorers. The town was built by the third
legion, which for generations, almost as a hereditary caste,
protected Roman civilisation against the restless tribes of the
desert. The chief buildings were probably completed in 117.
The preservation of so much, after eighteen centuries, is a
proof that the work was well and thoroughly done. The ruts
of carriage wheels can still be seen in the main street, which is
spanned by a triumphal arch, adorned with marble columns.
Porticoes and colonnades gave shelter from the heat to the
passers-by, and two fountains played at the further end. Water,
which is now invisible on the spot, was then brought in
channels from the hills, and distributed at a fixed rate among
private houses.<a id="noteref_1150" name="noteref_1150" href="#note_1150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1150</span></span></a> The forum was in the usual style, with raised

its theatre, where the seats can still be seen rising in their

The greatest glory of the imperial administration for
nearly two centuries was the skilful and politic tolerance
with which it reconciled a central despotism with a remarkable
range of local liberty. It did not attempt to impose a
uniform organisation or a bureaucratic control on the vast
mass of races and peoples whom the fortune of Rome had
brought under her sway. Rather, for ages its guiding
principle was, as far as possible, to leave ancient landmarks
undisturbed, and to give as much free play to local liberties
as was compatible with the safety and efficiency of the
imperial guardian of order and peace. Hence those many
diversities in the relation between provincial towns and Rome,
represented by the names of free, federate, or stipendiary
cities, municipium and colonia. Many retained their old
laws, constitution, and judicial system.<a id="noteref_1156" name="noteref_1156" href="#note_1156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1156</span></span></a> They retained in
some cases the names of magistracies, which recalled the
days of independence: there were still archons at Athens,
suffetes in African towns, demarchs at Naples. The title of
medixtuticus still lingered here and there in old Oscan
communities.<a id="noteref_1157" name="noteref_1157" href="#note_1157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1157</span></span></a> When she had crushed the national spirit,
and averted the danger of armed revolt, Rome tolerated, and
even fostered, municipal freedom, for more than a hundred
years after the last shadowy pretence of popular government
had disappeared from her own forum.<a id="noteref_1158" name="noteref_1158" href="#note_1158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1158</span></span></a> Central control and
uniformity were established in those departments which
affected the peace and welfare of the whole vast commonwealth.
Although the interference of the provincial governor
in local administration was theoretically possible in varying
degrees, yet it may well be doubted whether a citizen of
Lyons or Marseilles, of Antioch or Alexandria, was often
made conscious of any limitation of his freedom by imperial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>power. While delation and confiscation and massacre were
working havoc on the banks of the Tiber, the provinces were
generally tranquil and prosperous. The people elected their
magistrates, who administered municipal affairs with little
interference from government. The provincial administration
of a Nero, an Otho, a Vitellius, or a Domitian was often no less
prudent and considerate than that of a Vespasian or a Trajan.<a id="noteref_1159" name="noteref_1159" href="#note_1159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1159</span></span></a>

But although for generations there was a settled abstinence
from centralisation on the part of the imperial government,
the many varieties of civic constitution in the provinces
tended by an irresistible drift to a uniform type of organisation.
Free and federate communities voluntarily sought the position
of a colony or a municipium.<a id="noteref_1161" name="noteref_1161" href="#note_1161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1161</span></span></a> Just as the provincial town

city is an example of the magical power which Rome always
exercised on her most distant subjects, and even on the outer
world of barbarism, down to the last days when her forces
were ebbing away. The ease and rapidity of communication
along the great routes, the frequent visits of proconsuls and
procurators and generals, with the numerous train which
attended them, the presence of the ubiquitous Roman merchant
and traveller, kept even remote places in touch with the

Apart from the immense stimulus which was given to
trade and commerce by the pacification of the world, liberal
curiosity, or restless ennui, or the passion to preach and
propagate ideas, carried immense numbers to the most distant
lands.<a id="noteref_1165" name="noteref_1165" href="#note_1165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1165</span></span></a> The travelling sophist found his way to towns on the

part of a liberal culture in the days of Lucian as it was in the
days of Herodotus. The romantic charm of travel in Greece
was probably heightened for many by the tales of Thessalian
brigands and sorceresses which meet us in the novel of
Apuleius. The Emperor Hadrian, who visited almost every
interesting scene in his dominions, from the Solway to the
Euphrates, often trudging for days at the head of his soldiers,
is a true representative of the migratory tastes of his time.
Seneca, indeed, finds in this rage for change of scene only
a symptom of the universal unrest. Epictetus, on the other
hand, and Aristides expatiate with rapture on the universal
security and wellbeing, due to the disappearance of brigandage,
piracy, and war. The seas are alive with merchantmen;
deserts have become populous scenes of industry; the
great roads are carried over the broadest rivers and the most
defiant mountain barriers. The earth has become the common
possession of all. Nor is this mere rhetoric. Travelling to all
parts of the known world had become expeditious, and even
luxurious. From the Second Punic War, traders, couriers, and
travellers had moved freely along the great roads.<a id="noteref_1167" name="noteref_1167" href="#note_1167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1167</span></span></a> The

the model of the Persian, provided at regular intervals the
means of conveyance for officials, or for those furnished with
the requisite diploma. Private enterprise had also organised
facilities of travel, and at the gates of country towns such as
Pompeii, Praeneste, or Tibur, there were stations of the posting
corporations (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cisiarii</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jumentarii</span></span>) where carriages could

Martial’s book from Tarraco to Bilbilis.<a id="noteref_1171" name="noteref_1171" href="#note_1171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1171</span></span></a> About 130 miles a
day was the average distance accomplished by sea. Vessels put
out from Ostia or Puteoli for every port in the Mediterranean.
From Puteoli to Corinth was a voyage of five days. About
the same time was needed to reach Tarraco from Ostia. A
ship might arrive at Alexandria from the Palus Maeotis in a
fortnight.<a id="noteref_1172" name="noteref_1172" href="#note_1172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1172</span></span></a> Many a wandering sophist, like Dion Chrysostom

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was perhaps then commoner than it was, until quite recently,

often arranged for sleeping on a journey. We may be sure
that many an imperial officer after the time of Julius Caesar
passed nights in his carriage, while hurrying to join the forces
on the Rhine or the Danube. With all this rapid circulation
of officials and travellers, the far-stretching limits of the
Roman world must, to the general eye, have contracted, the
remotest places were drawn more and more towards the centre,
and the inexhaustible vitality of the imperial city diffused itself
with a magical power of silent transformation.

The modes in which the fully developed municipalities of
the Antonine age had originated and were organised were
very various. Wherever, as in the Greek East or Carthaginian
Africa, towns already existed, the Romans, of course, used them
in their organisation of a province, although they added liberally
to the number, as in Syria, Pontus, and Cappadocia.<a id="noteref_1178" name="noteref_1178" href="#note_1178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1178</span></span></a> Where
a country was still in the cantonal state, the villages or markets
were grouped around a civic centre, and a municipal town,
such as Nîmes or Lyons, would thus become the metropolis
of a considerable tract of territory. The colony of Vienne was
the civic centre of the Allobroges.<a id="noteref_1179" name="noteref_1179" href="#note_1179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1179</span></span></a> In the settlement of the

towns such as Tridentum, Verona, or Brixia.<a id="noteref_1180" name="noteref_1180" href="#note_1180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1180</span></span></a> Sometimes, as

it is well known that, especially towards the frontiers of the
Empire, in Britain, on the Rhine, and in North Africa, the
towns of the second century had often grown out of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">castra
stativa</span></span> of the legions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great reorganisation of Augustus had made each legion
a permanent corps, with a history and identity of its own.
To ensure the tranquillity of the Empire the legions were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>distributed in permanent camps along the frontier, the only
inland cities with a regular military garrison being Lyons and
Carthage.<a id="noteref_1182" name="noteref_1182" href="#note_1182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a> Many legions never changed their quarters for
generations. The Tertia Augusta, which has left so many
memorials of itself in the inscriptions of Lambaesis, remained,
with only a single break, in the same district from the time
of Augustus to that of Diocletian.<a id="noteref_1183" name="noteref_1183" href="#note_1183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1183</span></span></a> There, for two generations,
it kept sleepless watch against the robber tribes of the
Sahara. The legion was also peacefully employed in erecting
fortifications and making roads and bridges, when the camp was
visited by Hadrian in the year 130.<a id="noteref_1184" name="noteref_1184" href="#note_1184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1184</span></span></a> Gradually soldiers were
allowed to form family relations, more or less regular, until,
under Septimius Severus, the legionary was permitted to live
in his household like any other citizen.<a id="noteref_1185" name="noteref_1185" href="#note_1185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1185</span></span></a> From the remains
at Lambaesis, it is now considered certain that, in the third
century, the camp had ceased to be the soldier’s home. The
suttlers and camp-followers had long gathered in the neighbourhood
of the camp, in huts which were called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canabae legionis</span></span>.
There, for a long time, the soldier, when off duty, sought his
pleasures and amusements, and there, after the changes of
Septimius Severus, he took up his abode. At first the
Canabae of Lambaesis was only a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vicus</span></span>; it became, under
Marcus Aurelius, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">municipium</span></span>—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Respublica Lambaesitanorum</span></span>,
with the civic constitution which is rendered familiar to
us by so many inscriptions.<a id="noteref_1186" name="noteref_1186" href="#note_1186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1186</span></span></a> The Legionaries seem to have
been happy and contented at Lambaesis; their sons were trained
to arms and followed their fathers in the ranks;<a id="noteref_1187" name="noteref_1187" href="#note_1187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1187</span></span></a> the legion
became to some extent a hereditary caste. Old veterans
remained on the scene of their service, after receiving their
discharge with a pension from the chest.<a id="noteref_1188" name="noteref_1188" href="#note_1188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1188</span></span></a> The town developed
in the regular fashion, and dignified itself by a capitol,
an amphitheatre, two forums, a triumphal arch; and the many
monuments of public and private life found on the site reveal
a highly organised society, moulded out of barbarous and alien
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>elements, and stamped with the inimitable and enduring
impress of Rome. Out of such casual and unpromising
materials sprang numbers of urban communities, which reproduced,
in their outline and in their social tone, the forms and
spirit of the free Republic of Rome. The capitol and the
forum are merely the external symbols of a closer bond of
parentage. The Roman military discipline did not more
completely master and transform the Numidian or Celtic
recruit, than the inspiration of her civil polity diffused among
races imbruted by servitude, or instinct with the love of
a lawless, nomadic freedom, the sober attachment to an ordered
civic life which was obedient to a long tradition, yet vividly
interested in its own affairs.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On hardly any side of ancient life is the information
furnished by the inscriptions so rich as on the spirit and
organisation of municipalities. Here one may learn details of
communal life which are never alluded to in Roman literature.
From this source, also, we must seek the only authentic
materials for the reconstruction of a municipality of the first
century. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Album Canusii</span></span> and the tablets containing the
laws of Malaga and Salpensa have not only settled more than
one question as to the municipal organisation of the early
Empire, but have enabled us to form almost as clear-cut a
conception of it as we have of the corporate organisation of
our own great towns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, unlike our civic republics, the Roman municipal town
was distinctly aristocratic, or rather timocratic, in its constitution.
A man’s place in the community, as a rule, was fixed by his
ancestry, his official grade, or his capacity to spend. The
dictum of Trimalchio was too literally true in the municipal
life of that age—<span class="tei tei-q">“a man is what he is worth.”</span> Provincial
society was already parted and graduated, though less decidedly,
by those rigid lines of materialistic demarcation which became
gaping fissures in the society of the Theodosian code. The
Curia or Senate was open only to the possessor of a certain
fortune; at Como, for instance, HS.100,000, elsewhere perhaps
even more. On the other hand, the richest freedman could not
become a member of the Curia or hold any civic magistracy,<a id="noteref_1189" name="noteref_1189" href="#note_1189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1189</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>although he might be decorated with their insignia. His
ambition had to be satisfied with admission to the order of
the Augustales, which ranked socially after the members of the
Curia. In the list of the Curia, which was revised every five
years, the order of official and social precedence was most
scrupulously observed. In the Album Canusii of the year
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 223,<a id="noteref_1190" name="noteref_1190" href="#note_1190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1190</span></span></a> the first rank is assigned to thirty-nine patrons,
who have held imperial office, or who are senators or knights.
Next come the local magnates who have been dignified by
election to any of the four great municipal magistracies.
Last in order are the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pedani</span></span>, that is, the citizens possessing
the requisite qualification, who have not yet held any municipal
office. At the bottom of the list stand twenty-five <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praetextati</span></span>,
who were probably the sons of the more distinguished
citizens, and who, like the sons of senators of the Republic,
were silent witnesses of the proceedings in the Curia. From
this body, and from all the magistracies, all persons engaged
in certain mean or disgraceful occupations were expressly
excluded, along with the great mass of the poorer citizens,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tenuiores</span></span>. The taint of servile birth, the possession of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">libertinae opes</span></span>, was an indelible blot. In countless inscriptions
this gradation of rank is sharply accentuated. If a man leaves
a bequest for an annual feast, with a distribution of money, the
rich patron or the decurio will receive perhaps five times the
amount which is doled out to the simple plebeian.<a id="noteref_1191" name="noteref_1191" href="#note_1191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1191</span></span></a> The distinction
of rank, even in punishment for crime, which meets
us everywhere in the Theodosian Code, has already appeared.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">honestior</span></span> is not to be degraded by the punishment of
crucifixion or by the stroke of the rod.<a id="noteref_1192" name="noteref_1192" href="#note_1192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1192</span></span></a> But it is on their
tombs that the passion of the Romans for some sort of distinction,
however shadowy, shows itself most strikingly. On these slabs
every grade of dignity in a long career is enumerated with
minute care. The exact value of a man’s public benefactions
or his official salary will be recorded with pride.<a id="noteref_1193" name="noteref_1193" href="#note_1193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1193</span></span></a> Even the
dealer in aromatics or in rags will make a boast of some petty
office in the college of his trade.<a id="noteref_1194" name="noteref_1194" href="#note_1194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1194</span></span></a> But, although rank and office
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were extravagantly valued in these societies, wealth was after
all the great distinction. The cities were in the hands of the
rich, and, in return for social deference and official power, the
rich were expected to give lavishly to all public objects. The
worship of wealth, the monumental flattery of rich patrons and
benefactors, was very interested and servile. On the other
hand, there probably never was a time when the duties of wealth
were so powerfully enforced by opinion, or so cheerfully, and
even recklessly, performed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, although these communities were essentially aristocratic
in tone and constitution, the commonalty still retained some
power in the Antonine age. On many inscriptions they appear
side by side with the Curial <span class="tei tei-q">“ordo”</span> and the Augustales.<a id="noteref_1195" name="noteref_1195" href="#note_1195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1195</span></span></a> They
had still in the reign of Domitian the right to elect their
magistrates. It was long believed that, with the suppression
of popular elections at Rome in the reign of Tiberius, the
popular choice of their great magistrates must also have been
withdrawn from municipal towns.<a id="noteref_1196" name="noteref_1196" href="#note_1196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1196</span></span></a> This has now been disproved
by the discovery of the laws of Malaga and Salpensa,

uncontaminated election by the whole people.<a id="noteref_1197" name="noteref_1197" href="#note_1197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1197</span></span></a> And we can

placards, recommending particular candidates. There, in red
letters painted on the walls, we can read that <span class="tei tei-q">“the barbers
wish to have Trebius as aedile,”</span> or that <span class="tei tei-q">“the fruit-sellers, with
one accord, support the candidature of Holconius Priscus for
the duumvirate.”</span> The porters, muleteers, and garlic dealers
have each their favourite. The master fuller, Vesonius Primus,
backs Cn. Helvius as a worthy man. Even ladies took
part in the contest and made their separate appeals. <span class="tei tei-q">“His
little sweetheart”</span> records that she is working for Claudius.<a id="noteref_1199" name="noteref_1199" href="#note_1199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1199</span></span></a>
Personal popularity no doubt then, as always, attracted such
electoral support. But the student of the inscriptions may be
inclined to think that the free and independent electors had
also a keen eye for the man who was likely to build a new
colonnade for the forum, or a new <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">schola</span></span> for the guild, or, best
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of all, to send down thirty pairs of gladiators into the arena

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The laws of Malaga and Salpensa prescribe, in the fullest
detail, all the forms to be observed in the election of magistrates.
These were generally six in number—two duumvirs,<a id="noteref_1201" name="noteref_1201" href="#note_1201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1201</span></span></a> who were
the highest officers, two aediles, and two quaestors, for each year.
Every fifth year, instead of the duumvirs, two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quinquennales</span></span>
were elected, with the extraordinary duty of conducting the
municipal census.<a id="noteref_1202" name="noteref_1202" href="#note_1202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1202</span></span></a> The candidates for all these offices were
required to be free born, of the age of twenty-five at least, of
irreproachable character, and the possessors of a certain fortune.
The qualifications were the same as those prescribed by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lex
Julia</span></span> for admission to the municipal Senate, which expressly
excluded persons engaged in certain disreputable callings—gladiators,
actors, pimps, auctioneers, and undertakers.<a id="noteref_1203" name="noteref_1203" href="#note_1203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1203</span></span></a> In
the best days the competition for office was undoubtedly keen,
and the candidates were numerous. In the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 4, the year
of the death of C. <a name="corr212" id="corr212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Caesar</span>, the grandson of Augustus, so hot was
the rivalry that the town of Pisa was left without magistrates

ominous fact that the law of Malaga, in the reign of Domitian,
makes provision for the contingency of a failure of candidates.
In such a case the presiding duumvir was to nominate the required
number, they in turn an equal number, and the combined
nominees had to designate a third set equal in number to themselves.
The choice of the people was then restricted to these
involuntary candidates. The city has evidently advanced a stage
towards the times of the Lower Empire, when the magistrates
were appointed by the Curia from among themselves, with no
reference to the people.<a id="noteref_1205" name="noteref_1205" href="#note_1205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1205</span></span></a> A man might, indeed, well hesitate

the man chosen by the people often felt bound to outstrip the

must build or repair some public work, to signalise his year of
office, and, at the dedication of it, good taste required him to
exhibit costly games, or to give a banquet to the citizens, with a
largess to all of every rank small or great.<a id="noteref_1208" name="noteref_1208" href="#note_1208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1208</span></span></a>

But in return for its liabilities, the position of a duumvir
gave undoubted power and distinction. The office was the
image or shadow of the ancient consulship, and occasionally,

The Curia, or local senate, is peculiarly interesting to the historical
student, because it was to the conversion of the curiales
into a hereditary caste, loaded with incalculable liabilities,
that the decay of the Western Empire was to a large extent
due.<a id="noteref_1213" name="noteref_1213" href="#note_1213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1213</span></span></a> But, in the reign of Domitian, the Curia is still erect

second century there was no lack of candidates for admission.
Every five years the roll of the Curia was revised and drawn
up afresh by the quinquennales. The conditions were those
for holding a magistracy, including a property qualification,
which varied in different places.<a id="noteref_1216" name="noteref_1216" href="#note_1216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1216</span></span></a> The number of ordinary

and other extraordinary members. The quinquennales, in
framing the list, took first the members on the roll of the
previous term, and then those who had been elected to
magistracies since the last census. If any vacancies were still
left, they were filled up from the ranks of those who, not
having yet held any municipal office, were otherwise qualified
by the possession of a sufficient fortune.<a id="noteref_1218" name="noteref_1218" href="#note_1218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1218</span></span></a> In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Album

two-thirds of the Curia. In the composition of such a body
there would appear to be ample security for administrative
skill and experience. And yet we shall find that it was
precisely through want of prudence or skill that the door was
opened for that bureaucratic interference which, in the second
century, began, with momentous results, to sap the freedom
and independence of municipal life.

The honours and powers of the provincial council were
long sufficient to compensate the decurio for the heavy

few the career of imperial office and distinction was closed.

The pompous honorific titles of the Lower Empire, indeed,
had not come into vogue. But the Curial had a place of
honour at games and festivals, a claim to a larger share in
the distributions of money by private benefactors, exemption,
as one of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">honestiores</span></span>, from the more degrading forms of
punishment, the free supply of water from the public sources,<a id="noteref_1221" name="noteref_1221" href="#note_1221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1221</span></span></a>
and other perquisites and honours, which varied in different
localities. The powers of the Curia were also very considerable.
The duumvirs indeed possessed extensive prerogatives
which strong men may have sometimes strained.<a id="noteref_1222" name="noteref_1222" href="#note_1222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1222</span></span></a> But there
was a right of appeal to the Curia from judicial decisions of
the duumvirs in certain cases. And their control of games and
festivals, and of the finances of the community, was limited
by the necessity of consulting the Curia and of carrying out
its orders.<a id="noteref_1223" name="noteref_1223" href="#note_1223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1223</span></span></a> In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lex Ursonensis</span></span> we find a long list of

After the local aristocracy of curial rank came, in order of
social precedence, members of the knightly class and the order
of the Augustales. In the latter half of the first century equestrian
rank had been conferred with perhaps too lavish a hand.
And satire was never tired of ridiculing these sham aristocrats,
Bithynian knights as they were called, often of the lowest
origin, who on public occasions vulgarly asserted their mushroom
rank.<a id="noteref_1226" name="noteref_1226" href="#note_1226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1226</span></span></a> In particular, the army contributed many new
knights to the society of the provincial towns. A veteran,
often of humble birth, who had risen to the first place among
the sixty centurions of a legion, was, on his discharge with
a good pension, sometimes raised to equestrian rank. He
frequently returned to his native place, where he became a
personage of some mark. Such men, along with old officers of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>higher grade, frequently appear in the inscriptions invested

undoubtedly good and public-spirited men, with the peculiar
virtues which the life of the Roman camp engendered. But
some of their class also displayed that coarse and brutal self-assertion,
and that ignorant contempt for the refinement of
culture, on which Persius and Juvenal poured their scorn.<a id="noteref_1229" name="noteref_1229" href="#note_1229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1229</span></span></a>

The Augustales, ranking next to the curial order, are peculiarly
interesting, both as representing the wide diffusion of
the cult of the emperors, and as a class composed of men of
low, or even servile origin, who had made their fortunes in
trade, yet whose ambition society found the means of satisfying,
without breaking down the barriers of aristocratic exclusiveness.<a id="noteref_1230" name="noteref_1230" href="#note_1230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1230</span></span></a>
The origin of the order of the Augustales was long a subject of
debate. But it has now been placed beyond doubt that in
the provincial towns it was a plebeian institution for the cult
of Augustus, and succeeding emperors, modelled on the aristocratic
order of the Sodales Augustales, which was established
by Tiberius in the capital.<a id="noteref_1231" name="noteref_1231" href="#note_1231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1231</span></span></a> The Augustales were elected by
vote of the local curia, without regard to social rank, although
probably with due respect to wealth, and they included the
leaders of the great freedman class, whose emergence is one of
the most striking facts in the social history of the time.
Figuring on scores of inscriptions, the Augustales are mentioned
only once in extant Roman literature, in the novel of Petronius,
where the class has been immortalised, and probably caricatured.<a id="noteref_1232" name="noteref_1232" href="#note_1232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1232</span></span></a>
The inscription, for which Trimalchio gives an order to his
brother Augustal, the stone-cutter, is to record his election in
absence to the Sevirate, his many virtues and his millions.
Actual monuments at Assisi and Brescia show that Trimalchio
was not an altogether imaginary person.<a id="noteref_1233" name="noteref_1233" href="#note_1233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1233</span></span></a>

Yet the Augustales, in spite of the vulgar ostentation and
self-assertion, which have characterised similar classes of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nouveaux riches</span></span> in all ages, were a very important and useful
order. They overspread the whole Roman world in the West.
Their monuments have been traced, not only in almost every
town in Italy, and in great provincial capitals, like Lyons or
Tarraco, but in Alpine valleys and lonely outposts of civilisation
on the edge of the Sahara.<a id="noteref_1234" name="noteref_1234" href="#note_1234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1234</span></span></a> Their special religious duties
involved considerable expense, from which no doubt the more
aristocratic class were glad to be relieved. They had to bear
the cost of sacrifices and festivities on certain days in honour
of dead emperors. They had to pay an entrance fee on
admission to the college, which the ambitious among them
would often lavishly exceed.<a id="noteref_1235" name="noteref_1235" href="#note_1235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1235</span></span></a> They were organised on the
lines of other colleges, with patrons, quinquennales, and other
officials. They had their club-houses where their banquets
were regularly held, they possessed landed property, and had
their common places of burial.<a id="noteref_1236" name="noteref_1236" href="#note_1236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1236</span></span></a> But their expenditure and
their interests were by no means limited to their own immediate
society. They regarded themselves, and were generally
treated as public officials, ranking next to the magistrates of
the Curia. They had the right to wear the purple-bordered
toga, and to have lictors attending them in the streets.<a id="noteref_1237" name="noteref_1237" href="#note_1237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1237</span></span></a> Places
of honour were reserved for them at the games and festivals.
Although as a class they were not eligible for a seat in the
Curia, or for the municipal magistracies, yet the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ornamenta</span></span>, the
external badges and honours attached to these offices, were
sometimes granted even to freedmen who had done service to
the community. Thus an Augustal who had paved a road at
Cales received the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ornamenta</span></span> of a decurio.<a id="noteref_1238" name="noteref_1238" href="#note_1238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1238</span></span></a> And another, for
his munificence to Pompeii, by a decree of the Curia, was
awarded the use of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bisellium</span></span>, a seat of honour which was
usually reserved for the highest dignitaries.<a id="noteref_1239" name="noteref_1239" href="#note_1239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1239</span></span></a> But the ornaments
and dignities of their own particular college became
objects of pride and ambition. Thus a man boasts of having
been made <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">primus Augustalis perpetuus</span></span>, by a decree of the
Curia.<a id="noteref_1240" name="noteref_1240" href="#note_1240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1240</span></span></a> A worthy of Brundisium received from the Curia a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>public funeral, with the ornaments and insignia of an Augustal.<a id="noteref_1241" name="noteref_1241" href="#note_1241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1241</span></span></a>
In this way, in a society highly conventional, and dominated
by caste feeling, the order of the Augustales provided both a
stimulus and a reward for the public spirit of a new class,
powerful in its wealth and numbers, but generally encumbered
by the heritage of a doubtful origin. It was a great elevation
for a man, who, perhaps, had been sold as a boy in some
Syrian slave market into the degradation of a minion, and
who had emerged, by petty savings or base services, into the
comparative freedom of a tainted or despised trade, to find
himself at last holding a conspicuous rank in his municipality,
and able to purchase honour and deference from those who
had trampled on him in his youth.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Augustales shared with the members of the Curia the
heavy burdens which public sentiment then imposed upon the
rich. Direct taxation for municipal purposes was in the first
century almost unknown. The municipalities often possessed
landed property, mines, or quarries. Capua is said to have had
distant possessions in the island of Crete.<a id="noteref_1242" name="noteref_1242" href="#note_1242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1242</span></span></a> The towns also
derived an income from the public baths,<a id="noteref_1243" name="noteref_1243" href="#note_1243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1243</span></span></a> from the rent
of shops and stalls in the public places, from the supply
of water to private houses or estates, and from port dues
and tolls. A very considerable item of revenue must have
been found in the fee which all decurions, Augustales, and
magistrates paid on entering on their office or dignity.
Since the reign of Nerva, the towns had the right of receiving
legacies and bequests.<a id="noteref_1244" name="noteref_1244" href="#note_1244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1244</span></span></a> And, on the occurrence of any desolating
calamity, an earthquake or a fire, the emperor was never
slow or niggardly in giving relief. In the year 53 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> the town
of Bologna received an imperial subsidy of about £83,000.<a id="noteref_1245" name="noteref_1245" href="#note_1245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1245</span></span></a>

With regard to municipal expenditure, the budget was free
from many public charges which burden our modern towns.
The higher offices were unpaid, and in fact demanded large
generosity from their holders. The lower functions were dis<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>charged, to a great extent, by communal slaves. The care or
construction of streets, markets, and public buildings, although
theoretically devolving on the community through their aediles,
was, as a matter of fact, to an enormous extent undertaken by
private persons. The city treasury must have often incurred
a loss in striving to provide corn and oil for the citizens at a
limited price, and the authorities were often reviled, as at Trimalchio’s
banquet, for not doing more to cheapen the necessaries
of life.<a id="noteref_1247" name="noteref_1247" href="#note_1247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1247</span></span></a> Although our information as to municipal expenditure
on education and medical treatment is scanty, it is pretty clear
that the community was, in the Antonine age, beginning to
recognise a duty in making provision for both. Vespasian
first gave a public endowment to professors of rhetoric in the
capital.<a id="noteref_1248" name="noteref_1248" href="#note_1248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1248</span></span></a> The case of Como, described in Pliny’s Letters,
was probably not an isolated one. Finding that the youth
of that town were compelled to resort to Milan for higher
instruction, Pliny, as we have seen, proposed to the parents to
establish by general subscription a public school, and he offered
himself to contribute one-third of the sum required for the
foundation, the rest to be provided by the townsfolk, who were
to have the management and selection of teachers in their
hands.<a id="noteref_1249" name="noteref_1249" href="#note_1249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1249</span></span></a> The Greek cities had public physicians 500 years

departments of municipal expenditure were hardly yet fully
organised in the age of the Antonines, and were probably not
burdensome. The great field of expenditure lay in the
basilicas, temples, amphitheatres, baths, and pavements, whose

The municipal towns relied largely on the voluntary munificence
of their wealthy members for great works of public utility
or splendour. But we have many records of such enterprises
carried out at the common expense, and the name of a special
magistracy (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curator operum publicorum</span></span>) to superintend them

the misgovernment of the province.<a id="noteref_1256" name="noteref_1256" href="#note_1256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1256</span></span></a> Pliny’s correspondence
throws a flood of light on many points of municipal administration,
and foreshadows its coming decay. The cities appear
to have ample funds, but they are grossly mismanaged. There
is plenty of public money seeking investment, but borrowers
cannot be found at the current rate of 12 per cent. Pliny
would have been inclined to compel the decurions to become
debtors of the state, but Trajan orders the rate of interest to be
put low enough to attract voluntary borrowers.<a id="noteref_1257" name="noteref_1257" href="#note_1257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a> Apamea,

requested Pliny to examine the public accounts.<a id="noteref_1258" name="noteref_1258" href="#note_1258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1258</span></span></a> He did the

on a theatre, which, from some faults either in the materials
or the foundation, was settling, with great fissures in the walls.<a id="noteref_1260" name="noteref_1260" href="#note_1260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1260</span></span></a>
The city had also expended a large sum in rebuilding its
gymnasium on a sumptuous scale, but the fabric had been
condemned by a new architect for radical defects of structure.
Nicomedia has squandered £40,000 on two aqueducts which
have either fallen or been abandoned.<a id="noteref_1261" name="noteref_1261" href="#note_1261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1261</span></span></a> In authorising the construction

Pliny was most assiduous in devising or promoting engineering
improvements for the health and convenience of the province,
and often called for expert assistance from Rome. Irregularities
in the working of the civic constitutions also gave him
much trouble. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ecdicus</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">defensor</span></span> has demanded repayment
of a largess made to one Julius Piso from the treasury of
Amisus, which the decrees of Trajan now forbade.<a id="noteref_1264" name="noteref_1264" href="#note_1264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1264</span></span></a> Just as
Pliny had suggested that members of a curia should be forced
to accept loans from the State, so we can see ominous signs of
a wish to compel men to accept the curial dignity beyond the
legal number, in order to secure the honorarium of from £35
to £70 on their admission.<a id="noteref_1265" name="noteref_1265" href="#note_1265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1265</span></span></a> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lex Pompeia</span></span>, which forbade
a Bithynian municipality to admit to citizenship men from
other Bithynian states, had long been ignored, and in numbers
of cities there were many sitting in the senate in violation of
the law. The Pompeian law also required that a man should
be thirty years of age when he was elected to a magistracy or
took his place in the Curia, but a law of Augustus had reduced
the limit for the minor magistracies to twenty-two. Here was
a chance of adding to the strength of the Curia which was
seized by the municipal censors. And if a minor magistrate
might enter the Curia as a matter of course at twenty-two, why
not others equally fit?<a id="noteref_1266" name="noteref_1266" href="#note_1266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1266</span></span></a> In another typical case the legate
was disturbed by the lavish hospitality of leading citizens. On
the assumption of the toga, at a wedding, or an election to
civic office, or the dedication of a public work, not only the
whole of the Curia, but a large number of the common people,
were often invited to a banquet and received from their host
one or two denarii apiece.<a id="noteref_1267" name="noteref_1267" href="#note_1267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1267</span></span></a> Pliny was probably unnecessarily
alarmed. The inscriptions show us the same scenes all over
the Empire,<a id="noteref_1268" name="noteref_1268" href="#note_1268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1268</span></span></a> and the emperor with calm dignity leaves the question
of such entertainments to the prudence of his lieutenant.

There are many religious questions submitted to the
emperor in these celebrated despatches, especially those relating
to the toleration of Christians.<a id="noteref_1269" name="noteref_1269" href="#note_1269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1269</span></span></a> But, however profoundly
interesting, they lie beyond the scope of this chapter. We are
occupied with the secular life of the provincial town. And the
Letters of Pliny place some things in a clear light. In the first
place, the state has begun in the reign of Trajan to control
the municipality, especially in the management of its finances;
but the control is rather invited than imposed. At any rate,
it has become necessary, owing to malversation or incompetence.<a id="noteref_1270" name="noteref_1270" href="#note_1270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1270</span></span></a>
Nothing could be more striking than the contrast between
the civic bungling exposed by Pliny, and the clear, patient
wisdom of the distant emperor. And in another point we
can see that the municipalities have entered on that disastrous
decline which was to end in the ruin of the fifth century.
Wasteful finance is already making its pressure felt on
the members of the Curia, and membership is beginning to
be thought a burden rather than an honour. From the reign
of Trajan we begin to hear of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Curatores</span></span>, who were
imperial officers, appointed at first to meet a special emergency,
but who became permanent magistrates, with immense powers,
especially over finance.<a id="noteref_1271" name="noteref_1271" href="#note_1271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1271</span></span></a> The free civic life of the first century
is being quietly drawn under the fatal spell of a bureaucratic
despotism.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cities did much for themselves out of the public
revenues.<a id="noteref_1272" name="noteref_1272" href="#note_1272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1272</span></span></a> But there are many signs that private ambition
or munificence did even more. The stone records of
Pompeii confirm these indications in a remarkable way.
Pompeii, in spite of the prominence given to it by its tragic fate,
was only a third-rate town, with a population probably of not
more than 20,000.<a id="noteref_1273" name="noteref_1273" href="#note_1273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1273</span></span></a> Its remains, indeed, leave the impression
that a considerable class were in easy circumstances; but it
may be doubted whether Pompeii could boast of any great
capitalists among its citizens. Its harbour, at the mouth of
the Sarno, was the outlet for the trade of Nola and Nuceria.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>There were salt works in a suburb near the sea. The fish
sauces of Umbricius Scaurus had a great celebrity.<a id="noteref_1274" name="noteref_1274" href="#note_1274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1274</span></span></a> The
vine and the olive were cultivated on the volcanic offshoot
from Vesuvius; but the wine of Pompeii was said by the elder
Pliny to leave a lingering headache. Mill-stones were made
from the lava of the volcano. The market gardeners drove a
flourishing trade, and the cabbage of Pompeii was celebrated.
On the high ground towards Vesuvius many wealthy Romans,
Cicero, and Drusus, the son of Claudius, built country seats, in
that delicious climate where the winters are so short, and the
summer heats are tempered by unfailing breezes from the
mountains or the western sea. All these things made Pompeii
a thriving and attractive place; yet its trade hardly offered
the chance of the huge fortunes which could be accumulated
in those days at Puteoli or Ostia.<a id="noteref_1275" name="noteref_1275" href="#note_1275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1275</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless, a large number of the public buildings of
Pompeii were the gift of private citizens. The Holconii were
a great family of the place in the reign of Augustus. M.
Holconius Rufus had been ordinary duumvir five times, and
twice quinquennial duumvir; he was priest of Augustus, and
finally was elected patron of the town.<a id="noteref_1276" name="noteref_1276" href="#note_1276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1276</span></span></a> Such dignities in
those days imposed a corresponding burden. And an inscription
tells that, on the rebuilding of the great theatre, probably
about 3 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, Holconius Rufus and Holconius Celer defrayed
the expense of the crypt, the tribunals, and the whole space for
the spectators. Women did not fall behind men in their
public benefactions. On the eastern side of the forum of
Pompeii there is a building and enclosure, with the remains of
porticoes, colonnades, and fountains, which are supposed to
have been a cloth market. In a niche stood a marble statue,
dedicated by the fullers of Pompeii to Eumachia, a priestess of
the city. And Eumachia herself has left a record that she
and her son had erected the building at their own expense.<a id="noteref_1277" name="noteref_1277" href="#note_1277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1277</span></span></a>
The dedication probably belongs to the reign of Tiberius. The
visitor who leaves the forum by the arch, at the north-east
corner, and turns into the broadest thoroughfare of the town,
soon reaches the small temple of Fortuna Augusta, erected in
the reign of Augustus. Both the site and the building were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the gift of one M. Tullius, who had, like M. Holconius, borne all
the honours which the city could bestow.<a id="noteref_1278" name="noteref_1278" href="#note_1278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1278</span></span></a> The amphitheatre
in the south-east corner of the town, the scene of so many
gladiatorial combats recorded in the inscriptions, was erected
by two men of the highest official rank, C. Quinctius Valgus
and M. Porcius, probably the same men who bore at least part
of the cost of the smaller theatre of Pompeii.<a id="noteref_1279" name="noteref_1279" href="#note_1279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1279</span></span></a> The last
instance of this generous public spirit which we shall mention
is of interest in many ways. It is well known that in the
year 63 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> an earthquake overthrew many buildings, and
wrought great havoc in Pompeii. Among other edifices, the
temple of Isis was thrown down. The temple, of which we
can now study the remains, had been built by a boy of six
years of age, Numerius Popidius Celsinus, who, in acknowledgment
of his own, or rather of his father’s liberality, was at that
unripe age co-opted a member of <span class="tei tei-q">“the splendid order.”</span><a id="noteref_1280" name="noteref_1280" href="#note_1280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1280</span></span></a> This

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The literature of the age contains many records of profuse
private liberality of the same kind. The circle and family of
Pliny were, as we have seen in this, as in other respects, models
of the best sentiment of the time. Pliny was not a very rich
man, according to the standard of an age of colossal fortunes; yet
his benefactions, both to private friends and to the communities
in which he was interested, were on the scale of the largest
<a name="corr224" id="corr224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">wealth.</span> It has been calculated that he must have altogether
given to his early home and fatherland, as he calls it, a sum
of more than £80,000; and the gifts were of a thoroughly
practical kind—a library, a school endowment, a foundation for
the nurture of poor children, a temple of Ceres, with spacious
colonnades to shelter the traders who came for the great fair.<a id="noteref_1282" name="noteref_1282" href="#note_1282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1282</span></span></a>
A great lady, Ummidia Quadratilla, known to us not altogether
favourably in Pliny’s letters, built a temple and amphitheatre
for Casinum.<a id="noteref_1283" name="noteref_1283" href="#note_1283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1283</span></span></a> From the elder Pliny we learn that the distinguished
court physicians, the two Stertinii, whose professional
income is said to have ranged from £2000 to £5000 a
year, exhausted their ample fortune in their benefactions to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the city of Naples.<a id="noteref_1284" name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a> A private citizen bore the cost of an aqueduct
for Bordeaux, at an expenditure of £160,000.<a id="noteref_1285" name="noteref_1285" href="#note_1285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1285</span></span></a> Another
benefactor, one Crinas, spent perhaps £80,000 on the walls of
Marseilles.<a id="noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href="#note_1286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1286</span></span></a> The grandfather of Dion Chrysostom devoted his

according to his means, followed the example of his ancestor.
The site alone of a colonnade, with shops and booths, which he
presented to Prusa, cost about £1800. When Cremona was
destroyed by the troops of Vespasian in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 69, its temples and
forums were restored by the generous zeal of private citizens,
after all the horror and exhaustion of that awful conflict.<a id="noteref_1288" name="noteref_1288" href="#note_1288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1288</span></span></a>

But the prince of public benefactors in the Antonine age
was the great sophist Herodes Atticus, the tutor of M. Aurelius,
who died in the same year as his pupil, 180 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> He acted up
to his theory of the uses of wealth on a scale of unexampled
munificence.<a id="noteref_1289" name="noteref_1289" href="#note_1289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1289</span></span></a> His family was of high rank, and claimed descent
from the Aeacidae of Aegina. They had also apparently inexhaustible
resources. His father spent a sum of nearly
£40,000 in supplementing an imperial grant for the supply of
water to the Troad. The munificence of the son was extended
to cities in Italy, as well as to Corinth, Thessaly, Euboea,
Boeotia, Elis, and pre-eminently to Athens. He gave an
aqueduct to Canusium and Olympia, a racecourse to Delphi,
a roofed theatre to Corinth.<a id="noteref_1290" name="noteref_1290" href="#note_1290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1290</span></span></a> He provided sulphur baths at
Thermopylae for the visitors from Thessaly and the shores of
the Maliac gulf. He aided in the restoration of Oricum in
Epirus, and liberally recruited the resources of many another
decaying town in Greece. He was certainly benevolent, but
he had also a passion for splendid fame, and cherished an
ambition to realise the dream of Nero, by cutting a canal
across the Corinthian Isthmus.<a id="noteref_1291" name="noteref_1291" href="#note_1291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1291</span></span></a> But Attica, where he
was born, and where he had a princely house on the Ilissus,
was the supreme object of his bounty. In his will he left
each Athenian citizen an annual gift of a mina. He would
offer to the Virgin Goddess a sacrifice of a hundred oxen on a
single day; and, when the great festivals came round, he used to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feast the people by their tribes, as well as the resident strangers,
on couches in the Ceramicus. He restored the ancient shrines
and stadia with costly marbles. And, in memory of Rhegilla,
his wife, he built at the foot of the acropolis a theatre for
6000 spectators, roofed in with cedar wood, which, to the eye
of Pausanias, surpassed all similar structures in its splendour.<a id="noteref_1292" name="noteref_1292" href="#note_1292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1292</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The liberality of Herodes Atticus, however astonishing it
may seem, was only exceptional in its scale. The same spirit
prevailed among the leading citizens or the great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patroni</span></span> of
hundreds of communities, many of them only known to us
from a brief inscription or two; and we have great reason to
be grateful on this score to the imperial legislation of later
days, which did its best to preserve these stone records for the
eyes of posterity.<a id="noteref_1293" name="noteref_1293" href="#note_1293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1293</span></span></a> But in forming an estimate of the splendid
public spirit evoked by municipal life, it is well to remind
ourselves that much has necessarily been lost in the wreck of
time, and also that what we have left represents the civic life
of a comparatively brief period. Yet the remains are so
numerous that it is almost impossible to give any adequate
idea of their profusion to those who are unacquainted with
the inscriptions. The objects of this liberality are as various
as the needs of the community—temples, theatres, bridges,
markets, a portico or a colonnade, the relaying of a road or
pavement from the forum to the port, the repair of an aqueduct,
above all the erection of new baths or the restoration
of old ones, with perhaps a permanent foundation to provide
for the free enjoyment of this greatest luxury of the south.
The boon was extended to all citizens of both sexes, and in
some cases, even to strangers and to slaves.<a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href="#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a> There is an
almost monotonous sameness in the stiff, conventional record
of this vast mass of lavish generosity. It all seems a spontaneous
growth of the social system. One monument is

These are only a few specimens taken at random from the
countless records of similar liberality to the parent city. The
example of the emperors must have stimulated the creation
of splendid public works in the provinces. It has been

loaded with a debt of £320,000,000. Yet the frugal emperor

the Colosseum, and erected the famous baths.<a id="noteref_1306" name="noteref_1306" href="#note_1306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1306</span></span></a> Domitian once

temples to his <span class="tei tei-q">“divine”</span> father and brother, with many shrines

people, and an Odeum for an audience of 10,000.<a id="noteref_1307" name="noteref_1307" href="#note_1307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1307</span></span></a> Trajan

Nor was the encomium undeserved. He made docks and erected
warehouses at Ostia; he ran a new road through the Pomptine
marshes; he lavished money on aqueducts and baths.<a id="noteref_1309" name="noteref_1309" href="#note_1309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1309</span></span></a> His
most imposing construction was a new forum between the
Capitoline and the Quirinal, with stately memorials of the
achievements of his reign. But the prince of imperial builders
and engineers was Hadrian. Wherever he went he took with
him in his journeys a troop of architects to add something to
the splendour or convenience of the cities through which he
passed. <span class="tei tei-q">“In almost every city,”</span> says his biographer, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
erected some building.”</span><a id="noteref_1310" name="noteref_1310" href="#note_1310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1310</span></span></a> But the capital was not neglected
by Hadrian. He restored historic structures such as the
Pantheon and the temple of Neptune, the forum of Augustus,
and Agrippa’s baths, with no ostentatious intrusion of his
own name.<a id="noteref_1311" name="noteref_1311" href="#note_1311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1311</span></span></a> In his own name he built the temples of Venus
and Roma, the bridge across the Tiber, and that stately
mausoleum, which, as the castle of S. Angelo, links the
memory of the pagan Empire with the <a name="corr228" id="corr228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">mediaeval</span> Papacy and
the modern world. The example of the imperial masters of
the world undoubtedly reinforced the various impulses which
inspired the dedication of so much wealth to the public
service or enjoyment through all the cities of the Empire.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the wealthy and public-spirited citizen was also
expected to cater for the immediate pleasure or amusement of
his neighbours in games and feasts. We have seen that Pliny,
during his administration of Bithynia, seems to have regarded
the public feasts given to a whole commune on occasions of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>private rejoicing, as dangerous to the general tranquillity. Yet
the usage meets us everywhere in the inscriptions, and even in
the literary history of the time. This spacious hospitality was
long demanded from the rich and powerful, from the general
at his triumph, from the great noble on his birthday or his
daughter’s marriage, from the rich burgher at the dedication
of a temple or a forum which he had given to the city, from
the man who had been chosen patron of a town in expectation
of such largesses, not to speak of the many private patrons
whose morning receptions were thronged by a hungry crowd,
eager for an invitation to dinner, or its equivalent in the
sportula.<a id="noteref_1312" name="noteref_1312" href="#note_1312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1312</span></span></a> Julius Caesar on his triumph in 46 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> had

banquet halls for such popular repasts.<a id="noteref_1314" name="noteref_1314" href="#note_1314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1314</span></span></a> The Trimalchio of

no more popular and effective way of testifying gratitude for
the honours bestowed by the popular voice, or of winning
them, than by a great feast to the whole commune, generally
accompanied by a distribution of money, according to social
or official grade. It was also the most popular means of
prolonging one’s memory to bequeath a foundation for the
perpetual maintenance of such repasts in honour of the dead.<a id="noteref_1316" name="noteref_1316" href="#note_1316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1316</span></span></a>
One P. Lucilius of Ostia had held all the great offices of his town,
and had rewarded his admirers with a munificence apparently
more than equivalent to the official honours they had bestowed.
He had paved a long road from the forum to the arch, restored
a temple of Vulcan, of which he was the curator, and the
temples of Venus, Spes, and Fortuna; he had provided standard
weights for the meat market, and a tribunal of marble for the
forum. But probably his most popular benefaction was a
great banquet to the citizens, where 217 couches were arrayed
for them.<a id="noteref_1317" name="noteref_1317" href="#note_1317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1317</span></span></a> The same munificent person had twice entertained the
whole of the citizens at luncheon. Elsewhere a veteran, with
a long and varied service, had settled at Auximum where he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had been elected patron of the community. His old comrades,
the centurions of the Second Legion (Traj. Fortis) erected a
monument to his virtues, and, at the dedication, he gave a
banquet to the townsfolk.<a id="noteref_1318" name="noteref_1318" href="#note_1318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1318</span></span></a> One other example, out of the
many which crowd the inscriptions, may serve to complete
the picture of civic hospitality. Lucius Cornelius of Surrentum
received on his death the honour of a public funeral by a
vote of the Curia. The inscription on his statue records that, on
assuming the garb of manhood, he had provided a meal of pastry
and mead for the populace; when he became aedile, he exhibited
a contest of gladiators; and, twice reaching the honours
of the duumvirate, he repaid the compliment by splendid
games and a stately banquet.<a id="noteref_1319" name="noteref_1319" href="#note_1319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1319</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At these entertainments a gift of money, always graduated
according to the social rank of the guests, decurio, augustal,
or plebeian, was generally added to the fare.<a id="noteref_1320" name="noteref_1320" href="#note_1320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1320</span></span></a> Sometimes the
distribution took the form of a lottery. A high official of
Beneventum, who had probably inherited a fortune from his
father, a leading physician of the capital, once scattered
tickets among the crowd, which gave the finder the right to
a present of gold, silver, dress, or other smaller prizes.<a id="noteref_1321" name="noteref_1321" href="#note_1321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1321</span></span></a>
Women appeared sometimes both as hostesses and guests
on these occasions. Caesia Sabina of Veii, on the day on
which her husband was entertaining all the citizens, invited
the female relatives of the decurions to dinner, with the
additional luxury of a gratuitous bath.<a id="noteref_1322" name="noteref_1322" href="#note_1322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1322</span></span></a> It is curious to
observe that at the festivities in which women are entertained,
the sharp demarcation of ranks is maintained as strictly
as it is among their male relations. Thus, in a distribution
at Volceii, the decurions, augustales, and vicani, receive
respectively thirty, twenty, and twelve sesterces apiece; while
the proportion observed among the ladies of the three social
grades is sixteen, eight, and four. Nor were children, even
those of the slave class, forgotten on these festive occasions.
One kindly magnate of Ferentinum left a fund of about £750
to give an annual feast of pastry and mead upon his
birthday for all the inhabitants with their wives, and at the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>same time, 300 pecks of nuts were provided for the children,
bond and free.<a id="noteref_1323" name="noteref_1323" href="#note_1323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1323</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These provincial societies, as we have already seen, were organised
on aristocratic or plutocratic principles. The distinction
between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">honestior</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">humilior</span></span>, which becomes so cruel in the
Theodosian Code, was, even in the Antonine age, more sharply
drawn and more enduring than is agreeable to our modern
notions of social justice. The rich have a monopoly of all
official power and social precedence; they have even the
largest share in gifts and paltry distributions of money which
wealth might be expected to resign and to despise. Their sons
have secured to them by social convention, or by popular
gratitude and expectancy, a position equal to that of their
ancestors. The dim plebeian crowd, save for the right
of an annual vote at the elections, which was in a few
generations to be withdrawn, seem to be of little more
consequence than the slaves; they were of far less consequence
than those freedmen who had the luck or the
dexterity to build up a rapid fortune, and force their way
into the chasm between the privileged and the disinherited.
Yet this would hardly be a complete and penetrating view
of the inner working and the spirit of that municipal society.
The apparent rigidity and harshness of the lines of demarcation
were often relieved by a social sentiment which, on the
one hand, made heavy demands on rank and wealth, and on
the other, drew all classes together by the strong bond of
fellowship in a common social life. There has probably seldom
been a time when wealth was more generally regarded as a
trust, a possession in which the community at large has a
right to share. There never was an age in which the wealthy
more frankly, and even recklessly, recognised this imperious
claim. It would indeed be difficult to resolve into its
elements the complicated mass of motives which impelled
the rich burgher to undertake such enormous, and often
ruinous, expenditure for the common good or pleasure. There
was of course much of mere selfish ambition and love of
popularity. The passion for prominence was probably never
stronger. Direct or even veiled corruption of the electors was,
indeed, strictly prohibited by law.<a id="noteref_1324" name="noteref_1324" href="#note_1324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1324</span></span></a> But it was a recognised
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>principle of public life that the city should honour its benefactors,
and that those whom she had raised to her highest
distinctions should manifest their gratitude by some contribution
to the comfort or the enjoyments of the people. But,
when we have admitted all vulgar motives of munificence, a
man would show himself a very unobservant, or else a very
cynical student of the time, if he failed to recognise that,
among these countless benefactors, there were many animated,
not only by a sense of duty, but by a real ardour of public
spirit, men who wished to live in the love and memory of
their fellows, and who had a rare perception of the duties of
wealth. Philostratus has left us in his own words a record
of the principles which inspired Herodes Atticus in his almost
fabulous donations to many cities in Asia, Greece, and Italy.
Herodes used to say that the true use of money was to succour
the needs of others; riches which were guarded with a niggard
hand were only a <span class="tei tei-q">“dead wealth”</span>; the coffers in which they
were stowed away were merely a prison; and the worship of
money resembled the sacrifice which the fabled Aloidae offered
to a god after putting him in chains.<a id="noteref_1325" name="noteref_1325" href="#note_1325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1325</span></span></a> The main characteristics
of human nature are singularly fixed from age to age,
although the objects of its love and devotion may endlessly
vary. The higher unselfish impulses must assert themselves
in any society which is not plunging into the abyss. The
choicer spirits will be always ready to lavish effort or material
wealth on objects which are sacred to their own age, although
they may seen chimerical or unworthy to the next. And we
may well believe that the man who in the second century
built a bath or a theatre for fellow townsmen, might possibly,
had he lived in the fifth, have dedicated a church to a patron
saint, or bequeathed his lands to a monastery.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Antonine age was on one side perhaps rather coarse in
its ideals, passionately fond of splendour and brilliant display,
proud of civic dignity, and keenly alive to the ease and
comfort and brightness which common effort or individual
generosity might add to the enjoyment of life. It was also
an intensely sociable age. Men looked for their happiness to
their city rather than to the family or the state. If their city
could not play a great part as an independent commonwealth,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it might, by the self-sacrifice of its sons, assert its dignity
among its rivals. It could make itself a society which men
would proudly or affectionately claim as their <span class="tei tei-q">“patria”</span> and
their parent, and on which they would vie with one another in
lavishing their time and their gold. And the buildings and
banquets and bright festivals, on which so much was lavished,
were enjoyed by all citizens alike, the lowest and the highest,
although high and low had sometimes by prescriptive usage an
unequal share in the largesses. The free enjoyment of sumptuous
baths, of good water from the Atlas, the Apennines, or the
Alban Hills, the right to sit at ease with one’s fellows when
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pseudolus</span></span> or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> was put upon the boards, the
pleasure of strolling in the shady colonnades of the forum or
the market, surrounded by brilliant marbles and frescoes, with
fountains shedding their coolness around; the good fellowship
which, for the time, levelled all ranks, in many a simple communal
feast, with a coin or two distributed at the end to recall
or heighten the pleasure—all these things tended to make the
city a true home, to some extent almost a great family circle.
There was much selfishness and grossness, no doubt, in all this
civic life. Which later age can cast the first stone? Yet
a study of the inscriptions of the Antonine age leaves the
impression that, amid all the sharply drawn distinctions of
rank, with all the petty ambition and self-assertion, or the
fawning and expectant servility, there was also a genuine
patriotic benevolence on the one hand, and a grateful recognition
of it on the other. The citizens record on many a tablet
their gratitude to patron or duumvir or augustal, or to some
simple old centurion, returned from far frontier camps, who
had paved their promenade, or restored their baths, or given
them a shrine of Neptune or Silvanus. They also preserved
the memory of many a kindly benefactor who left, as he fondly
thought for ever, the funds for an annual feast, with all the
graduated shares scrupulously prescribed, to save an obscure
tomb from the general oblivion. Thus, although that ancient
city life had its sordid side, which is laid bare with such
pitiless Rabelaisian realism by Petronius, it had its nobler
aspect also. Notwithstanding the aristocratic tone of municipal
society in the age of the Antonines, it is possible that the
separation of classes in our great centres of population is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>morally more sharp and decided than it was in the days when
the gulf between social ranks was in theory impassable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is however another side to this picture of fraternal
civic life. If some of its pleasures were innocent and even
softening and elevating, there were others which pandered to
the most brutal and cruel passions. The love of amusement
grew upon the Roman character as civilisation developed in
organisation and splendour, and unfortunately the favourite
amusements were often obscene and cruel. The calendar of
the time is sufficiently ominous. The number of days which
were annually given up to games and spectacles at Rome rose
from 66 in the reign of Augustus, to 135 in the reign of
M. Aurelius, and to 175, or more, in the fourth century. In
this reckoning no account is taken of extraordinary festivals
on special occasions.<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href="#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a> The Flavian amphitheatre was inaugurated
by Titus with lavish exhibitions extending over 100
days.<a id="noteref_1327" name="noteref_1327" href="#note_1327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a> The Dacian triumphs of Trajan were celebrated by
similar rejoicings for 123 days, and 10,000 gladiators were
sent down into the arena.<a id="noteref_1328" name="noteref_1328" href="#note_1328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1328</span></span></a> The rage of all classes of the
Roman populace for these sights of suffering and shame continued
unabated to the very end of the Western Empire. The
lubricity of pantomime and the slaughter of the arena were
never more fiercely and keenly enjoyed than when the Germans
were thundering at the gates of Trèves and Carthage.<a id="noteref_1329" name="noteref_1329" href="#note_1329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1329</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is difficult for us now to understand this lust of cruelty
among a people otherwise highly civilised, a passion which was
felt not merely by the base rabble, but even by the cultivated
and humane.<a id="noteref_1330" name="noteref_1330" href="#note_1330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1330</span></span></a> There was undoubtedly at all times a coarse
insensibility to suffering in the Roman character. The institution
of slavery, which involves the denial of ordinary human
rights to masses of fellow-creatures, had its usual effect in rendering
men contemptuously callous to the fate of all who did not
belong to the privileged class. Even a man of high moral tone
like Tacitus, while he condemns Drusus for gloating over his
gladiatorial shows, has only a word of scorn for the victims
of the butchery.<a id="noteref_1331" name="noteref_1331" href="#note_1331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1331</span></span></a> And the appetite grew with what it fed on.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>From father to son, for nearly seven centuries, the Roman
character became more and more indurated under the influence
of licensed cruelty. The spectacle was also surrounded
by the emperors, even the greatest and best, for politic reasons,
with ever growing splendour. The Flavian amphitheatre,
which remains as a monument of the glory of the Empire and
of its shame, must have been a powerful corruptor. There,
tier above tier, was gathered the concentrated excitability and
contagious enthusiasm of 87,000 spectators. The imperial
circle and the emperor himself, members of high senatorial
houses, the great officers of state, the priests, the vestal virgins,
gave an impressive national dignity to the inhuman spectacle.
And now and then an Eastern prince or ambassador, or the
chief of some half-savage tribe in Germany or Numidia,<a id="noteref_1332" name="noteref_1332" href="#note_1332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1332</span></span></a> amused
the eyes of the rabble who swarmed on the upper benches.
Every device of luxurious art was employed to heighten the baser
attractions of the scene. The magnificent pile was brightened
with gems of artistic skill.<a id="noteref_1333" name="noteref_1333" href="#note_1333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1333</span></span></a> The arena was tesselated with rich
colouring from the sunlight which streamed through the awnings.
The waters of perfumed fountains shot high into the air, spreading
their fragrant coolness; and music filled the pauses in the
ghastly conflict. From scenes like these was probably drawn
the picture in the Apocalypse: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mulier circumdata purpura et

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first and second centuries the passion for cruel
excitement was as strong in the provincial towns as it was even
at Rome. This may have been partly due to the monotony of
provincial life. It was also stimulated by the ease with which
public sentiment extorted the means for these gratifications
from the richer citizens. The opinion of the powerful and
enlightened class, with rare exceptions, made no effort to purify
and humanise the grossness of the masses. Seneca and Demonax
indeed display a modern humanity in their view of the degrading
influence of these displays.<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a> A humane magistrate of

for blood.<a id="noteref_1338" name="noteref_1338" href="#note_1338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1338</span></span></a> The imperial gladiators were organised elaborately

presided over by officers of high rank. The gentle Pliny,

It is little wonder that, with such examples and such
approval, the masses gloated unrestrained over these inhuman
sports. The rag-dealer at Trimalchio’s dinner is certainly
drawn to the life.<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href="#note_1341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1341</span></span></a> They are going to have a three days’
carnival of blood. There is to be no escape; the butcher is
to do his work thoroughly in full view of the crowded tiers
of the amphitheatre. It was in Etruria, and in Campania,
where Trimalchio had his home, that the gladiatorial combats
took their rise. Campanian hosts used to entertain their guests
at dinner with them in the days before the second Punic War.<a id="noteref_1342" name="noteref_1342" href="#note_1342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1342</span></span></a>
And it was in Campanian towns that in the first century was
displayed most glaringly the not unusual combination of
cruelty and voluptuousness. The remains of Pompeii furnish
us with the most vivid and authentic materials for a study of
the sporting tastes of a provincial town. It is significant
that the amphitheatre of Pompeii, which was capable of
holding 20,000 people, was built fifty years before the first
stone amphitheatre erected by Statilius Taurus at Rome.<a id="noteref_1343" name="noteref_1343" href="#note_1343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1343</span></span></a> It
is also remarkable that, although Pompeii is mentioned only
twice by Tacitus, one of the references is to a bloody riot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>arising out of the games of the amphitheatre.<a id="noteref_1344" name="noteref_1344" href="#note_1344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1344</span></span></a> In the year
59 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> a Roman senator in disgrace, named Livineius Regulus,
gave a great gladiatorial show at Pompeii, which attracted
many spectators from the neighbouring town of Nuceria.
The scenes of the arena were soon reproduced in a fierce
street fight between the people of the two towns, in which
many Nucerians were left dead or wounded. The catastrophe
was brought before the emperor, and referred by him to the
Senate, with the result that Pompeii was sternly deprived of
its favourite amusement for a period of ten years. But when
the interdict was removed, the Pompeians had the enjoyment
of their accustomed pleasure for ten years more, till it was
finally interrupted by the ashes of Vesuvius.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A building at Pompeii, which was originally a colonnade
connected with the theatre,<a id="noteref_1345" name="noteref_1345" href="#note_1345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1345</span></span></a> had been converted into barracks
for a school of gladiators in the time of the early Empire.<a id="noteref_1346" name="noteref_1346" href="#note_1346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1346</span></span></a>
Behind the colonnade of more than seventy Doric columns
had been built a long row of small cells, with no opening
except on the central enclosure. There was a mess room,
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exedra</span></span> on the southern side served as a retiring
room for the trainers and the men in the intervals of
exercise. The open area was used for practice. These
buildings have yielded many specimens of gladiators’ arms,
helmets, and greaves richly embossed in relief, scores of mail-coats,
shields, and horse-trappings. In one room there were
found the stocks, and four skeletons with irons on their legs.
In another, eighteen persons had taken refuge in the last
catastrophe, and, among them, a woman wearing costly jewels.
The walls and columns were covered with inscriptions and
rude sketches of gladiatorial life. Indeed the graffiti relating
to it are perhaps the most interesting in Pompeii. On some
of the tombs outside the city we can still read the notices
of coming games, painted on the walls by a professional
advertiser, one Aemilius Celer, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the light of the moon.”</span><a id="noteref_1347" name="noteref_1347" href="#note_1347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1347</span></span></a>
They announce that a duumvir or aedile or flamen will exhibit
twenty or thirty pairs of combatants on the calends of May
or the ides of April. There will also be a hunt, athletic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>games, a distribution of gifts, and awnings will be provided.
Programmes were for sale in advance, with a list of the
events. The contents of one can still be read scratched on
a wall, with marginal notes of the results of the competition.
In one conflict, Pugnax, in the Thracian arms, had beaten
Murranus the Myrmillo, fighting in the arms of Gaul, with
the fish upon his helmet; and the fate of Murranus is
chronicled in one tragic letter p. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">periit</span></span>). Two others fought
in chariots in old British fashion. And the Publius Ostorius
who won was, as his name may suggest, a freedman, now
fighting as a voluntary combatant, according to the inscription,
in his fifty-first conflict.<a id="noteref_1348" name="noteref_1348" href="#note_1348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1348</span></span></a> The tomb of Umbricius Scaurus, on
the highway outside the Herculaneum gate, was adorned in
stucco relief with animated scenes from the arena of hunting
and battle. Hunters with sword and cloak, like a modern
toréador, are engaging lions or tigers. Two gladiators are
charging one another on horseback. Here, a vanquished
combatant, with upturned hand, is imploring the pity of
the spectators, while another is sinking in the agony of death
upon the sand. The name, the school, and the fighting
history of each combatant are painted beside the figure.<a id="noteref_1349" name="noteref_1349" href="#note_1349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1349</span></span></a>
The universal enthusiasm for the shows is expressed in many
a rude sketch which has been traced by boyish hands upon
the walls. The record of the heroes of the arena was evidently
then as familiar as that of a champion footballer or
cricketer is now to our own sporting youth. In the peristyle
of a house in Nola Street, the names of some thirty gladiators
can be read, with the character of their arms and the number
of their conflicts. Portraits of gladiators are figured on lamps
and rings and vases of the period. The charm of their manly
strength, according to Juvenal, was fatal to the peace of many
a Roman matron of the great world. And the humbler girls
of Pompeii have left the memorial of their weakness in more
than one frank outburst of rather unmaidenly admiration.<a id="noteref_1350" name="noteref_1350" href="#note_1350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1350</span></span></a>

It is a grave deduction from the admiring judgment of the
glory of the Antonine age, that its most splendid remains
are the stately buildings within whose enclosure, for centuries,
the populace were regaled with the sufferings and the blood of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the noblest creatures of the wild animal world and of gallant
men. The deserts and forests of Africa and the remotest East
contributed their elephants and panthers and lions to these
scenes. And every province of the Empire sent its contingent
of recruits for the arena, Gaul, Germany, and Thrace, Britain
and Dacia, the villages of the Atlas, and the deserts of the
Soudan.<a id="noteref_1351" name="noteref_1351" href="#note_1351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1351</span></span></a> Just in proportion to the depth of the impress made by
Roman civilisation, was the amphitheatre more or less popular
in the provinces. In Italy itself the passion was naturally
strongest. Quiet little places, buried in the Apennines, or in
the mountains of Samnium, had their regular spectacles, and
record their gratitude for the pleasure to some magistrate or
patron.<a id="noteref_1352" name="noteref_1352" href="#note_1352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1352</span></span></a> The little town of Fidenae, in the reign of Tiberius,

An augustal of Praeneste endowed his town with a school of

his first duumvirate, on the Apollinaria, gave an exhibition in the
forum of bull-fighting, pugilism, and pantomime. He signalised
his second tenure of the office by a show of thirty-five pairs
of gladiators, with a hunting scene of bulls, boars, and bears.<a id="noteref_1355" name="noteref_1355" href="#note_1355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1355</span></span></a>

munificence might be produced from Bovianum and Beneventum,
from Tibur and Perusia, and many another obscure Italian
town. But the brutal insensibility of the age is perhaps nowhere
so glaringly paraded as in the days following the short-lived
victory of the Vitellian arms at Bedriacum. There, on
that ghastly plain, on which his rival had been crushed and
had closed a tainted life by a not inglorious death, Vitellius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gloated over the wreck of the great struggle. The trees were cut
down, the crops trampled into mire; the soil was soaked and
festering with blood, while mangled forms of men and horses
still lay rotting till the vultures should complete their obsequies.
Within forty days of the battle, the emperor attended great
gladiatorial combats given by his generals at Cremona and
Bononia, as if to revive the memory of the carnage by a
cruel mimicry.<a id="noteref_1358" name="noteref_1358" href="#note_1358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1358</span></span></a> The grim literary avenger of that carnival of
blood has pictured the imperial monster’s end, within a short
space, in colours that will never fade, deserted by his meanest
servants, shuddering at the ghastly terrors of the vast, silent
solitudes of the palace, dragged forth from his hiding, and flung
with insults and execrations down the Gemonian Stairs. The
dying gladiator of Cremona was more than avenged.<a id="noteref_1359" name="noteref_1359" href="#note_1359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1359</span></span></a>

The western provinces bordering on the Mediterranean, Gaul,
Spain, and Africa, drank deepest of the spirit which created the
great amphitheatres of Arles, Trèves, and Carthage, Placentia and
Verona, of Puteoli, Pompeii, and Capua. But the East caught
the infection, and gladiatorial combats were held at Antioch in
Pisidia, at Nysa in Caria, and at Laodicea; Alexandria had its
amphitheatre from the days of Augustus, and a school of
gladiators, presided over by a high imperial officer.<a id="noteref_1360" name="noteref_1360" href="#note_1360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1360</span></span></a> The
Teutonic regions of the north and Greece were almost the only
provinces in which the bloody games were not popular. The
one Greek town where the taste for them was fully developed
was the mongrel city of Corinth, which was a Roman colony.
In the novel of Apuleius we meet a high Corinthian magistrate
travelling through Thessaly to collect the most famous gladiators
for his shows.<a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a> Yet even in Greece, even at Athens, which had
been the home of kindly pity from the days of Theseus, the cruel

The games of the arena were sometimes held at the expense
of the municipality on great festivals, with a public officer,
bearing the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curator</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a> to direct them. But, perhaps more
frequently, they were given by great magistrates or priests at
their own expense; or some rich <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span>, like the cobbler of
Bologna or the fuller of Modena, who have been ridiculed by
Martial, would try by such a display to force an entrance into
the guarded enclosure of Roman rank.<a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a> There were also frequent
bequests to create a permanent agonistic foundation.
The most striking example of such a legacy is to be found on
an inscription in honour of a munificent duumvir of Pisaurum.
He left a capital sum of more than £10,000 to the community.
The interest on two-fifths of this bequest, perhaps amounting
to £500, was to be spent in giving a general feast on the
birthday of the founder’s son. The accumulated interest of the
remaining three-fifths, amounting, perhaps, to £4000, was to
be devoted to a quinquennial exhibition of gladiators.<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366" href="#note_1366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1366</span></span></a> An

The profession of gladiator was long regarded as a tainted
one, on which social sentiment and law alike placed their
ban. It was a calling which included the vilest or the most
unfortunate of mankind. Slaves, captives in war, or criminals
condemned for serious offences, recruited its ranks.<a id="noteref_1373" name="noteref_1373" href="#note_1373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1373</span></span></a> The death
in the arena was thus often, really, a deferred punishment for
crime. But even from the later days of the Republic, men of
free birth were sometimes attracted by the false glory or the
solid rewards of the profession. Freedmen sometimes fought
at the call of their patrons.<a id="noteref_1374" name="noteref_1374" href="#note_1374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1374</span></span></a> And, when Septimius Severus
began to recruit the Pretorian guard from the provinces, the
youth of Italy, who had long enjoyed the monopoly of that
pampered corps, satisfied their combative or predatory instincts
by joining the ranks either of the gladiators or of the brigands.<a id="noteref_1375" name="noteref_1375" href="#note_1375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1375</span></span></a>
The gladiator had, indeed, to submit to fearful perils and a
cruel discipline. His oath bound him to endure unflinchingly
scourging, burning, or death.<a id="noteref_1376" name="noteref_1376" href="#note_1376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1376</span></span></a> His barracks were a closely
guarded prison, and, although his fare was necessarily good,
his training was entirely directed to the production of a fine
fighting animal, who would give good sport in the arena. Yet
the profession must have had some powerful attractions.
Some of the emperors,<a id="noteref_1377" name="noteref_1377" href="#note_1377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1377</span></span></a> Titus and Hadrian, themselves took a
pleasure in the gladiatorial exercises. Commodus, as if to

viragoes.<a id="noteref_1379" name="noteref_1379" href="#note_1379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1379</span></span></a> The splendour of the arms, the ostentatious pomp
of the scene of combat, the applause of thousands of spectators
on the crowded benches, the fascination of danger, all this
invested the cruel craft with a false glory.<a id="noteref_1380" name="noteref_1380" href="#note_1380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1380</span></span></a> The mob of

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>skilful gladiator evidently became a hero under the early
Empire, like his colleague of the red or green. His professional
record was of public interest; the number of his
combats and his victories was inscribed upon his tomb.<a id="noteref_1381" name="noteref_1381" href="#note_1381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1381</span></span></a> His

as his pathetic dignity in death has been immortalised in
marble. The memories of a nobler life of freedom sometimes
drove the slave of the arena to suicide or mutiny.<a id="noteref_1383" name="noteref_1383" href="#note_1383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1383</span></span></a> But he was
oftener proud of his skill and courage, and eager to display
them. When shows were rare in the reign of Tiberius, a
Myrmillo was heard to lament that the years of his glorious

masseurs, surgeon-dressers, and physicians to attend to
the general health of the members. There were various
grades according to skill or length of service, and a man
might rise in the end to be trainer of a troop. Gladiators,
like all other callings in the second century, had their colleges.
We have the roll of one of these, in the year 177 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>,

decuries, evidently according to professional rank, and their
names and arms are also given. Their comrades often erected
monuments to them with a list of their achievements. Thus
a dear companion-in-arms commemorates a young Secutor at
Panormus, who died in his thirtieth year, who had fought in
thirty-four combats, and in twenty-one came off victorious.<a id="noteref_1388" name="noteref_1388" href="#note_1388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1388</span></span></a>

The inscriptions pay all honour to the voluntary, single-minded
generosity with which men bore costly charges, and
gave time and effort to the business of the city. But there
was a tendency to treat public benefactions as the acknowledgment
of a debt, a return for civic honours. We can sometimes
even see that the gift was extorted by the urgency of the
people, in some cases even by menaces and force.<a id="noteref_1392" name="noteref_1392" href="#note_1392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1392</span></span></a> The cities
took advantage of the general passion for place and social
precedence, and, often from sordid motives, crowded their
curial lists with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patroni</span></span> and persons decorated with other
honorary distinctions. On the famous roll of the council of
Canusium, out of a total of 164 members, there are 39
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patroni</span></span> of senatorial or knightly rank, and 25 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praetextati</span></span>,
mere boys, who were almost certainly of the same aristocratic
class, and were probably destined to be future patrons of
the town.<a id="noteref_1393" name="noteref_1393" href="#note_1393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1393</span></span></a> In the desire to secure the support of wealth and
social prestige, the municipal law as to the age for magisterial

sometimes raised to the highest civic honours.<a id="noteref_1394" name="noteref_1394" href="#note_1394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1394</span></span></a> The position

paid for. A great man with a liberal soul might be patron of
several towns,<a id="noteref_1395" name="noteref_1395" href="#note_1395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1395</span></span></a> and sometimes women of rank had the honour

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or an augustal, might be co-opted into the <span class="tei tei-q">“splendid order”</span>

is plain that such distinctions had to be purchased or repaid.
The city seldom made any other return for generous devotion,
unless it were the space for a grave or the pageant of a public
funeral. It is true that a generous benefactor or magistrate is
frequently honoured with a statue and memorial tablet. Indeed,
the honour is so frequently bestowed that it seems to dwindle
to an infinitesimal value.<a id="noteref_1398" name="noteref_1398" href="#note_1398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1398</span></span></a> And it is to our eyes still further

The Antonine age was an age of splendid public spirit and
great material achievement. But truth compels us to recognise
that even in the age of the Antonines, there were ominous signs
of moral and administrative decay. Municipal benefactors
were rewarded with local fame and lavish flattery; but the
demands of the populace, together with the force of example
and emulation, contributed to make the load which the rich
had to bear more and more heavy. Many must have ruined
themselves in their effort to hold their place, and to satisfy an
exacting public sentiment. Men actually went into debt to
do so;<a id="noteref_1402" name="noteref_1402" href="#note_1402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1402</span></span></a> and as municipal life became less attractive or more
burdensome, the career of imperial office opened out and
offered far higher distinction. The reorganisation of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>imperial service by Hadrian had immense effects in diverting
ambition from old channels. It created a great hierarchy of
office, which absorbed the best ability from the provinces.
Provincials of means and position were constantly visiting the
capital for purposes of private business or pleasure, or to
represent their city as envoys to the emperor. They often
made powerful friends during their stay, and their sons, if not
they themselves, were easily tempted to abandon a municipal
career for the prospect of a high place in the imperial army
or the civil service.<a id="noteref_1403" name="noteref_1403" href="#note_1403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1403</span></span></a> It is true that the local tie often remained
unbroken. The country town, of course, was proud
of the distinction to which its sons rose in the great world;
and many a one who had gained a knighthood or some military
rank, returned to his birthplace in later years, and was
enrolled among its patrons. We may be sure that many a
successful man, like the Stertinii of Naples, paid <span class="tei tei-q">“nurture
fees”</span> in the most generous way. But already in the reign of
Domitian, as we have seen, legal provision had to be made for
the contingency of an insufficient number of candidates for the
municipal magistracies. Already, in the reign of Trajan, the
cities of Bithynia are compelling men to become members
of the Curia, and lowering the age of admission to official
rank.<a id="noteref_1404" name="noteref_1404" href="#note_1404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1404</span></span></a> Plutarch laments that many provincials are turning

hold even the highest magistracy at Thebes or Athens from
what it was in the great days of Salamis or Leuctra. But
Plutarch accepts the Empire as inevitable. He appreciates
its blessings as much as Aristides or Dion Chrysostom. He
has none of the revolutionary rage which led Apollonius to
cast reproaches at Vespasian, or to boast of his complicity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the overthrow of Nero.<a id="noteref_1408" name="noteref_1408" href="#note_1408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1408</span></span></a> He has little sympathy with
philosophers like Epictetus, who would sink the interests of
everyday politics in the larger life of the universal commonwealth
of humanity. The Empire has extinguished much
of civic glory and freedom, but let us recognise its compensating
blessings of an ordered peace. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spartam nactus es, hanc
exorna</span></span>, might be the motto of Plutarch’s political counsels. He
himself, with a range of gifts and culture, which has made his
name immortal, did not disdain to hold a humble office in the
poor little place which was his home. And he appeals to the
example of Epameinondas, who gave dignity to the magistracy
which was concerned with the duty of the cleansing of the
sewers and streets of Thebes.<a id="noteref_1409" name="noteref_1409" href="#note_1409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1409</span></span></a> He tells his young pupil that,
although we have now no wars to wage, no alliances to conclude,
we may wage war on some evil custom, revive some
charitable institution, repair an aqueduct, or preside at a sacrifice.
Yet Plutarch has a keen insight into the municipal
vices of his age, the passion for place and office, the hot
unscrupulous rivalry which will stoop to any demagogic arts,
the venality of the crowd, and the readiness of the rich to
pamper them with largesses and shows, the insane passion for
pompous decrees of thanks and memorial statues; above all,
the eager servility which abandoned even the poor remnant of
municipal liberty, and was always inviting the interference of
the prince on the most trivial occasions.<a id="noteref_1410" name="noteref_1410" href="#note_1410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1410</span></span></a> Such appeals paralyse
civic energy and hasten the inevitable drift of despotism. He
exhorts men to strive by every means to raise the tone of
their own community, instead of forsaking it in fastidious
scorn, or ambition for a more spacious and splendid life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The growing distaste for municipal honours was to some
extent caused by bureaucratic encroachments on the independence
of the Curia. As early as the reign of Trajan there are
unmistakable signs, as we have seen, of financial mismanagement
and decay. The case of Bithynia, in Trajan’s reign, is
sometimes treated as an exceptional one. It may be doubted
whether it is not a conspicuous example of general disorganisation.
The Bithynian towns were probably not alone
in their ill-considered expenditure on faultily planned aqueducts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and theatres. Apamea was certainly not the only city
which called for an imperial auditor of its accounts. Inscriptions
of the reign of Trajan show that many towns in
Italy, Como, Canusium, Praeneste, Pisa, Bergamum, and
Caere, had curators of their administration appointed, some as
early as the reigns of Hadrian or Trajan.<a id="noteref_1411" name="noteref_1411" href="#note_1411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1411</span></span></a> These officers,
who were always unconnected with the municipality, took
over the financial control, which had previously belonged to
the duumvirs and quaestors. They were often senators or
equites of high rank, and a single curator sometimes had the
supervision of several municipalities. The case of Caere is
peculiarly instructive and interesting.<a id="noteref_1412" name="noteref_1412" href="#note_1412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1412</span></span></a> There, an imperial freedman,
named Vesbinus, proposed to erect at his own cost
a club-house (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phretrium</span></span>), for the augustales, and asked the
municipal authorities for a site close to the basilica. At a
formal meeting of the Curia, the ground was granted to him,
subject to the approval of Curiatius Cosanus, the curator,
with a vote of thanks for his liberality. A letter to that
official was drawn up, stating the whole case, and asking for
his sanction. The curator, writing from Ameria, granted it in
the most cordial terms. It is noteworthy that at the very time
when Caere was consulting its curator about the proposal of
Vesbinus,<a id="noteref_1413" name="noteref_1413" href="#note_1413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1413</span></span></a> the Bithynian cities were laying bare their
financial and engineering difficulties to Pliny and Trajan. The
glory of free civic life is already on the wane. The municipality
has invited or submitted to imperial control. The burdens of
office have begun to outweigh its glory and distinction. In a
generation or two the people will have lost their elective power,
and the Curia will appoint the municipal officers from its own
ranks. It will end by becoming a mere administrative machine
for levying the imperial taxes; men will fly from its crushing
obligations to any refuge; and the flight of the curiales will
be as momentous as the coming of the Goths.<a id="noteref_1414" name="noteref_1414" href="#note_1414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1414</span></span></a>

The judgment on that externally splendid city life of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Antonine age will be determined by the ideals of the inquirer.
There was a genuine love of the common home, a general pride
in its splendour and distinction. And the duty, firmly
imposed by public sentiment on the well-endowed to contribute
out of their abundance to its material comfort and its glory,
was freely accepted and lavishly performed. Nor was this
expenditure all devoted to mere selfish gratification. The
helplessness of orphanhood and age, the penury and monotonous
dulness of the lives of great sunken classes, the education of
the young, were drawing forth the pity of the charitable. Munificence
was often indeed, in obedience to the sentiment of the
time, wasted on objects which were unworthy, or even to our
minds base and corrupting. Men seemed to think too much of
feasting and the cruel amusement of an hour. Yet when a whole
commune was regaled at the dedication of a bath or a temple,
there was a healthy social sympathy diffused for the moment
through all ranks, which softened the hard lines by which that
ancient society was parted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, in looking back, we cannot help feeling that over
all this scene of kindliness and generosity and social good-will,
there broods a shadow. It is not merely the doom of free
civic life, which is so clearly written on the walls of every curial
hall of assembly from the days of Trajan, to be fulfilled
in the long-drawn tragedy of the fourth and fifth centuries;
three hundred years have still to run before the inevitable
catastrophe. It is rather the feeling which seems to lurk
under many a sentence, half pitiful, half contemptuous, of
M. Aurelius, penned, perhaps, as he looked down on some
gorgeous show in the amphitheatre, when the Numidian
lion was laid low by a deft stroke of the hunting-spear, or
a gallant Myrmillo from the Thames or the Danube sank
upon the sand in his last conflict.<a id="noteref_1415" name="noteref_1415" href="#note_1415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1415</span></span></a> It is the feeling of
Dion, when he watched the Alexandrians palpitating with
excitement over a race in the circus, or the cities of Bithynia
convulsed by some question of shadowy precedence or the
claim to a line of sandhills. It is the swiftly stealing shadow
of that mysterious eclipse which was to rest on intellect and
literature till the end of the Western Empire. It is the
burden of all religious philosophy from Seneca to Epictetus,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which was one long warning against the perils of a materialised
civilisation. The warning of the pagan preacher was
little heeded; the lesson was not learnt in time. Is it
possible that a loftier spiritual force may find itself equally
helpless to arrest a strangely similar decline?

But the common people are now as a rule chiefly known to us
from the inscriptions on their tombs. Fortunately there is an
immense profusion, in all the provinces as well as in Italy, of
these brief memorials of obscure lives. And although Roman
literature, which was the product of the aristocratic class or
of their dependents, generally pays but little attention to the
despised mass engaged in menial services or petty trades, we
have seen that the novel of Petronius flashes a brilliant light
upon it in the reign of Nero.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The immense development of the free proletariat, in the
time of the early Empire, is one of the most striking social
phenomena which the study of the inscriptions has brought to
light. It has sometimes been the custom to speak of that
society as depending for the supply of its wants entirely on slave
labour. And undoubtedly at one time slave labour occupied
the largest part of the field of industry. A household in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>time of the Republic, of even moderate wealth, might have
400 slaves, while a Crassus would have as many as 20,000,
whom he hired out in various industries.<a id="noteref_1419" name="noteref_1419" href="#note_1419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1419</span></span></a> But several causes
conspired gradually to work a great industrial revolution.
From the days of Augustus, the wars beyond the frontier,
which added fresh territory and yielded crowds of captives to
the slave-markets, had become less frequent. And it is probable
that births among the slave class hardly sufficed to
maintain its numbers against the depletion caused by mortality
and manumission. The practice of emancipating slaves of
the more intelligent class went on so rapidly that it had even
to be restrained by law.<a id="noteref_1420" name="noteref_1420" href="#note_1420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1420</span></span></a> Masters found it economically
profitable to give skilful slaves an interest in the profits of
their industry, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span>, which was thus accumulated,
soon provided the means of purchasing emancipation. At
the same time, the dispersion of colossal fortunes, gained in the
age of rapine and conquest, and squandered in luxury and
excess, together with the exploitation of the resources of
favoured regions, which were now enjoying the blessings of
unimpeded commerce, rapid intercommunication, and perfect
security, must have given an immense stimulus to free
industry. A very casual glance at the inscriptions, under
the heading <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Artes et Opificia</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1421" name="noteref_1421" href="#note_1421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1421</span></span></a> will show the enormous
and flourishing development of skilled handicrafts, with
all the minutest specialisation of the arts that wait on a
highly-organised and luxurious society. The epitaphs of these
obscure toilers have been brought to light in every part of
the Roman world, in remote towns in Spain, Gaul, Noricum,
Dacia, and North Africa, as well as in the ancient centres of
refinement in Italy or the Greek East. On a single page or
two you can read the simple record of the bridle-maker or
flask-maker of Narbonne, the cabriolet-driver of Senegallia, the
cooper of Trèves, the stone-cutter of Nîmes, the purple-dealer
of Augsburg, beside those of the wool-comber of Brescia, the
oculist of Bologna, the plumber of Naples, or the vendors of
unguents in the Via Sacra, and the humble fruiterer of the
Circus Maximus.<a id="noteref_1422" name="noteref_1422" href="#note_1422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1422</span></span></a> Many of these people had risen from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>slavery into the freedman class. Most of them are evidently
humble folk, although, like a certain female pearl-dealer of the
Via Sacra, they may have freedmen and freedwomen of their
own, for whom they provide a last resting-place beside themselves.<a id="noteref_1423" name="noteref_1423" href="#note_1423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1423</span></span></a>
The barber, or auctioneer, or leather-seller, who had
become the owner of lands and houses, and who could even
give gladiatorial shows, excited the contempt of Juvenal and
Martial.<a id="noteref_1424" name="noteref_1424" href="#note_1424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1424</span></span></a> But these insignificant people, although despised by
the old world of aristocratic tradition, were proud of their crafts.
They tell posterity who and what they were, without any vulgar
concealment; nay, they have left expensive tombs, with the
emblems or instruments of their petty trades proudly blazoned
upon them like the armorial devices of our families of gentle
birth. In the museum of S. Germain may be seen the effigy
of the apple-seller commending his fruit to the attention of the
ladies of the quarter; the cooper, with a cask upon his shoulder;
the smith, hammer in hand, at the forge; the fuller, treading
out and dressing the cloth.<a id="noteref_1425" name="noteref_1425" href="#note_1425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1425</span></span></a> This pride in honest industry is
a new and healthy sign, as a reaction from the contempt for it
which was engrained in old Roman society, and which is always
congenial to an aristocratic caste supported by slave labour.
In spite of the grossness and base vulgarity of sudden wealth,
portrayed by Petronius and Juvenal, the new class of free
artisans and traders had often, so far as we can judge by stone
records, a sound and healthy life, sobered and dignified by
honest toil, and the pride of skill and independence. Individually
weak and despised, they were finding the means of
developing an organisation, which at once cultivated social
feeling, heightened their self-respect, and guarded their collective
interests. While the old aristocracy were being rapidly
thinned by vice and extravagance, or by confiscation, the leaders
of the new industrial movement probably founded many a
senatorial house, which, in the fourth and fifth centuries, in an
ever-recurring fashion, came to regard manual industry with
sublime contempt, and traced themselves to Aemilius Paullus
or Scipio, or even to Aeneas or Agamemnon.<a id="noteref_1426" name="noteref_1426" href="#note_1426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1426</span></span></a>

The organisation of industry through the colleges attained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>an immense development in the Antonine age, and still more
in the third century, after the definite sanction and encouragement
given to these societies by Alexander Severus. The
records of the movement are numerous, and we can, after the
scholarly sifting of recent years, now form a tolerably complete
and vivid conception of these corporations which, springing up
at first spontaneously, in defiance of government, or with its
reluctant connivance, were destined, under imperial control, to
petrify into an intolerable system of caste servitude in the last
century of the Empire of the West.<a id="noteref_1427" name="noteref_1427" href="#note_1427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1427</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sodalitia and collegia were of immemorial antiquity.
Certain industrial colleges and sacred sodalities were traced
back to Numa, and even to the foundation of Rome.<a id="noteref_1428" name="noteref_1428" href="#note_1428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1428</span></span></a> In the
flourishing days of the Republic they multiplied without
restraint or suspicion, the only associations at which the law
looked askance being those which met secretly or by night.
It was only in the last century of the Republic that the
colleges came to be regarded as dangerous to the public peace,
and they were, with some necessary exceptions, suppressed by
a decree of the Senate in 64 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> They were revived again
for factious or revolutionary purposes in 58 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> by Clodius.<a id="noteref_1429" name="noteref_1429" href="#note_1429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1429</span></span></a>
The emperors Julius and Augustus abolished the free right of
association, except in the case of a few consecrated by their
antiquity or their religious character.<a id="noteref_1430" name="noteref_1430" href="#note_1430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1430</span></span></a> And it was enacted
that new colleges could not be created without special
authorisation. In the middle of the second century, the jurist
Gaius lays it down that the formation of new colleges
was restrained by laws, decrees of the Senate, and imperial
constitutions, although a certain number of societies, both in
Rome and the provinces, such as those of the miners, salt
workers, bakers, and boatmen, were authorised.<a id="noteref_1431" name="noteref_1431" href="#note_1431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1431</span></span></a> And down to
the time of Justinian, the right of free association was jealously
watched as a possible menace to the public peace. The
refusal of Trajan to sanction the formation of a company of
firemen in Nicomedia, with the reasons which he gave to
Pliny for his decision, furnishes the best concrete illustration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the imperial policy towards the colleges.<a id="noteref_1432" name="noteref_1432" href="#note_1432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1432</span></span></a> That the
danger from the colleges to the public order was not an
imaginary one, is clear from the passage in Tacitus describing
the bloody riots between the people of Nuceria and Pompeii in
the reign of Nero, which had evidently been fomented by
<span class="tei tei-q">“illicit”</span> clubs.<a id="noteref_1433" name="noteref_1433" href="#note_1433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1433</span></span></a> It is seen even more strikingly in the serious
troubles of the reign of Aurelian, when 7000 people were
killed in the organised outbreak of the workmen of the mint.<a id="noteref_1434" name="noteref_1434" href="#note_1434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1434</span></span></a>
Yet it is pretty clear that, in spite of legislation, and imperial
distrust, the colleges were multiplying, not only in Rome, but
in remote, insignificant places, and even in the camps, from
which the legislator was specially determined to avert their
temptations. In the blank wilderness, created by a universal
despotism, the craving for sympathy and mutual succour
inspired a great social movement, which legislation was powerless
to check. Just as in the reigns of Theodosius and
Honorius, imperial edicts and rescripts were paralysed by the
impalpable, quietly irresistible force of a universal social
need or sentiment. One simple means of evasion was provided
by the government itself, probably as early as the first
century. In an inscription of Lanuvium, of the year 136 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>,
there is a recital of a decree of the Senate according the
right of association to those who wish to form a funerary
college, provided the members did not meet more than once a
month to make their contributions.<a id="noteref_1435" name="noteref_1435" href="#note_1435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1435</span></span></a> It appears from
Marcian’s reference to this law that other meetings for
purposes of religious observance might be held, the provisions
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">senatusconsultum</span></span> against illicit colleges being
carefully observed.<a id="noteref_1436" name="noteref_1436" href="#note_1436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1436</span></span></a> Mommsen has shown that many other
pious and charitable purposes could be easily brought within
the scope of the funerary association. And it was not
difficult for a society which desired to make a monthly
contribution for any purpose to take the particular form
recognised by the law. In the reign of M. Aurelius, although
membership of two colleges is still prohibited, the colleges
obtained the legal right to receive bequests, and to emancipate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their slaves. And finally, Alexander Severus organised all
the industrial colleges and assigned them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">defensores</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1437" name="noteref_1437" href="#note_1437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1437</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The law against illicit associations, with all its serious
penalties, remained in the imperial armoury. But the Empire,
which had striven to prevent combination, really furnished
the greatest incentive to combine. In the face of that world-wide
and all-powerful system, the individual subject felt, ever
more and more, his loneliness and helplessness. The imperial
power might be well-meaning and beneficent, but it was so
terrible and levelling in the immense sweep of its forces, that
the isolated man seemed, in its presence, reduced to the insignificance
of an insect or a grain of sand. Moreover, the aristocratic
constitution of municipal society became steadily more and more
exclusive. If the rich decurions catered for the pleasures of
the people, it was on the condition that they retained their
monopoly of political power and social precedence. The
plebeian crowd, recruited from the ranks of slavery, and ever
growing in numbers and, in their higher ranks, in wealth, did
not indeed dream of breaking down these barriers of exclusiveness;
but they claimed, and quietly asserted, the right to
organise a society of their own, for protection against oppression,
for mutual sympathy and support, for relief from the deadly
dulness of an obscure and sordid life. Individually weak and
despised, they might, by union, gain a sense of collective
dignity and strength. To our eyes, as perhaps to the eyes of
the Roman aristocrat, the dignity might seem far from imposing.
But these things are greatly a matter of imagination, and
depend on the breadth of the mental horizon. When the
brotherhood, many of them of servile grade, met in full conclave,
in the temple of their patron deity, to pass a formal
decree of thanks to a benefactor, and regale themselves with
a modest repast, or when they passed through the streets and
the forum with banners flying, and all the emblems of their
guild, the meanest member felt himself lifted for the moment
above the dim, hopeless obscurity of plebeian life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No small part of old Roman piety consisted in a scrupulous
reverence for the dead, and a care to prolong their memory
by solid memorial and solemn ritual, it might be to maintain
some faint tie of sympathy with the shade which had passed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into a dim and rather cheerless world. The conception of
that other state was always vague, often purely negative. It
is not often that a spirit is sped on its way to join a loved
one in the Elysian fields, and we may fear that such phrases,
when they do occur, are rather literary and conventional.<a id="noteref_1438" name="noteref_1438" href="#note_1438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1438</span></span></a> The

of the deepest feelings in the Roman mind did duty for a
clear faith in the life beyond the tomb: one was family piety,
the other the passionate desire of the parting spirit to escape
neglect and oblivion. Whoever will cast his eyes over some
pages of the sepulchral inscriptions will be struck with the
intensity and warmth of affection, the bitterness of loss and
grief, which have been committed to the stone. The expressions,
of course, are often conventional, like obituary memorials in
every age. The model wife appears again and again, loving,
chaste, pious, a woman of the antique model, a keeper at home,
who spun among her maids and suckled her own children, who
never gave her husband a moment’s vexation, except when she
died.<a id="noteref_1440" name="noteref_1440" href="#note_1440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1440</span></span></a> Good husbands seem to have been not less common.
And the wife’s grief sometimes far outruns the regular forms
of eulogy or regret. In one pathetic memorial of a union
formed in earliest youth, the lonely wife begs the unseen
Powers to let her have the vision of her spouse in the hours
of night, and bring her quickly to his side.<a id="noteref_1441" name="noteref_1441" href="#note_1441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1441</span></span></a> There is just the
same pure affection in the less regular, but often as stable,
unions of the slaves and soldiers, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">contubernalis</span></span> is
lamented with the same honourable affection as the great lady,
although the faulty Latin sometimes betrays the class to which
the author belongs. The slave world must always have its
shame and tragedy; yet many an inscription shows, by a
welcome gleam of light, that even there human love and ties
of family were not always desecrated.<a id="noteref_1442" name="noteref_1442" href="#note_1442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1442</span></span></a> The slave nurse

of the dead. For the public authorities had a direct pecuniary
interest in enforcing the penalty for the desecration. But it

protect for ever the peace of the departed fulfilled the hopes
of the testator.

The primary object of a multitude of colleges, like that
of the worshippers of Diana and Antinous at Lanuvium, was
undoubtedly, after the reign of Nerva, the care of the memory
of their members after death. In the remarkable inscription
of Lanuvium, as we have seen, the formal permission by
decree of the Senate, to meet once a month for the purpose of
a funerary contribution is recorded.<a id="noteref_1452" name="noteref_1452" href="#note_1452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1452</span></span></a> It was a momentous

or may not have intended.<a id="noteref_1453" name="noteref_1453" href="#note_1453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1453</span></span></a> The jurist Marcian, who gives
an imperfect citation of this part of the decree, goes on to
add, that meetings for a religious purpose were not prohibited,
provided that the previous legislation against illicit societies
was observed.<a id="noteref_1454" name="noteref_1454" href="#note_1454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1454</span></span></a> And the law of the Lanuvian College shows
how often such meetings might take place. It did not need
much ingenuity to multiply occasions for reunion. The
anniversary of the foundation, the birthday of founders or
benefactors, the feast of the patron deity, the birthday of the
emperor, these and the like occasions furnished legal pretexts
for meetings of the society, when the members might have a
meal together, and when the conversation would not always
be confined to the funerary business of the college. At a
time when, according to juristic theory, a special permission
was needed for each new foundation, and when the authority
was grudgingly accorded, the whole vast plebeian mass of
petty traders, artisans, freedmen, and slaves were at one stroke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>allowed to organise their societies for burial. We may
fairly assume that, liberally interpreted, the new law was
allowed to cover with its sanction many a college of which
funeral rites were not the sole, or even the primary object.
And this would be made all the easier because many of the
industrial colleges, and perhaps still more of the strictly
religious colleges, had a common burial-place, and often
received bequests for funerary purposes. This is the case,
for example, with a college of worshippers of Hercules at
Interamna, and a similar college at Reate.<a id="noteref_1455" name="noteref_1455" href="#note_1455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1455</span></span></a> A young Belgian,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are, by a rare piece of good fortune, admitted to the
interior of one of the purely funerary colleges. In the reign
of Hadrian there was at Lanuvium a college which, by a
curious fancy, combined the worship of the pure Diana
with that of the deified minion of the emperor. It was
founded in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 133, three years after the tragic death of
the young favourite. And in 136, the patron of the society,
who was also a magnate of the town, caused it to be convened
in the temple of Antinous. There he announced
the gift of a sum of money, the interest of which was to be
spent at the festivals of the patron deities; and he directed
that the deed of foundation should be inscribed on the inner
walls of the portico of the temple, so that newly admitted
members might be informed of their rights and their obligations.
This document, discovered among the ruins of the
ancient Lanuvium in 1816, reveals many important facts in
the constitution and working of funerary colleges.<a id="noteref_1459" name="noteref_1459" href="#note_1459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1459</span></span></a> It recites,
as we have seen, a part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">senatusconsultum</span></span>, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>authorised the existence of such colleges, and after loyal
wishes for the prosperity of the emperor and his house, it
prays for an honest energy in contributing to the due interment
of the dead, that by regular payments the society may
prolong its existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The entrance fee of the college is to be 100 sesterces
(16s. 8d.), together with a flagon of good wine. A monthly
subscription of five asses is appointed. It is evident that
the members are of the humblest class, and one clause shows
that they have even a sprinkling of slaves among them, who,
with the permission of their masters, might connect themselves
with these burial clubs.<a id="noteref_1460" name="noteref_1460" href="#note_1460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1460</span></span></a> The brethren could not aspire
to the erection even of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">columbarium</span></span>, still less to the possession
of a common burial-ground. They confined themselves
to making a funeral grant of HS.300 to the appointed heir
of each member who had not intermitted his payments to the
common fund.<a id="noteref_1461" name="noteref_1461" href="#note_1461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1461</span></span></a> Out of this sum, HS.50 are to be paid to
members present at the funeral. The member dying intestate
will be buried by the society, and no claim upon his remaining
interest in it will be recognised. The slave, whose
body was retained by his master after death, was to have a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">funus imaginarium</span></span>, and probably a cenotaph. In the case
of a member dying within a radius of twenty miles from
Lanuvium, three members, on timely notice, were deputed to
arrange for the funeral, and required to render an account of the
expenses so incurred. A fee of HS.20 was granted to each.
But if any fraud were discovered in their accounts, a fine of
quadruple the amount was imposed. Lastly, when a member
died beyond the prescribed limit, the person who had arranged
his funeral, on due attestation by seven Roman citizens, and
security given against any further claims, received the burial
grant, with certain deductions.<a id="noteref_1462" name="noteref_1462" href="#note_1462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1462</span></span></a> In such precise and orderly
fashion, with all the cautious forms of Roman law, did this
poor little society order its performance of duty to the
dead.

Our knowledge of the funerary colleges is still further
amplified by an inscription of a date twenty years later than

named Salvia Marcellina resolved to commemorate her husband
by a gift to the college of Aesculapius and Hygia. She
presented to it the site for a shrine close to the Appian Way,
a marble statue of Aesculapius, and a hall opening on a terrace,
where the banquets of the brotherhood should be held. To
this benefaction Marcellina, along with one P. Aelius Zeno,
who apparently was her brother, added two donations of
HS.15,000 and HS.10,000 respectively, the interest of
which was to be distributed in money, or food and wine, at
six different festivals. The proportions assignable to each rank
in the college were determined at a full meeting, held in the
shrine of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Titus.”</span> Marcellina attaches certain
conditions to her gift. The society is to be limited to sixty
members, and the place of each member, on his decease, is to
be filled by the co-optation of his son. If any member
chooses to bequeath his place and interest, his choice is
confined to his son, his brother, or his freedman, and he is
required to pay for this limited freedom of selection by refunding
one-half of his burial grant to the chest of the
college.<a id="noteref_1464" name="noteref_1464" href="#note_1464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1464</span></span></a> The college of Aesculapius is nominally a religious

in a long document, to the subject of burial. No information is
given as to the amount of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">funeraticium</span></span> or burial grant, the
sources from which it is derived, or the conditions on which
it is to be paid. The chief object of Marcellina seems to have
been to connect the memory of her husband with a number of
festivals, for the perpetuity of which she makes provision, to
promote social intercourse, and to prevent the intrusion of
strangers by making membership practically hereditary.

The colleges, of whose inner working we have tried to give
a picture, are classed as religious corporations in the collections
of the inscriptions. They bear the name of a god, and
they provide a solemn interment for their members. But in
these respects they do not differ from many other colleges
which are regarded as purely secular. The truth is, that any
attempt to make a sharp division of these societies on such
lines seems futile. Sepulture and religion being admitted by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>government as legitimate objects for association, any college,
however secular in its tone, might, and probably would, screen
itself under sacred names. Nor would this be merely a
hypocritical pretence. It is clear that many of the purely
industrial colleges, composed as they were of poor people who
found it impossible to purchase a separate burial-place, and
not easy, unaided, to bear the expense of the last rites, at once
consulted their convenience, and gratified the sentiment of
fraternity, by arranging for a common place of interment.
And with regard to religion, it is a commonplace to point out
that all Graeco-Roman societies, great or small, rested on
religion. The state, the clan, the family, found their ideal
and firmest bond in reverence for divine or heroic ancestors, a
reverent piety towards the spirits who had passed into the
unseen world. The colleges, as we shall see presently, were
formed on the lines of the city which they almost slavishly
imitated.<a id="noteref_1465" name="noteref_1465" href="#note_1465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1465</span></span></a> It would be strange and anomalous if they should
desert their model in that which was its most original and
striking characteristic. And just as Cleisthenes found divine
and heroic patrons for his new tribes and demes,<a id="noteref_1466" name="noteref_1466" href="#note_1466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1466</span></span></a> so would a
Roman college naturally place itself under the protection of
one of the great names of the Roman pantheon. Sometimes,
no doubt, there may not have been much sincerity in this
conformity to ancient pieties. But do we need to remind
ourselves how long a life the form of ancient pieties may
have, even when the faith which gave birth to them has
become dim and faint?

The usual fashion of writing Roman history has concentrated
attention on the doings of the emperor, the life of the
noble class in the capital, or on the stations of the legions and
the political organisation of the provinces. It is a stately and
magnificent panorama. But it is apt to throw the life of the
masses into even deeper shadow than that in which time has
generally enwrapped them. We are prone to forget that,
behind all this stately life, there was a quiet yet extraordinarily
busy industrial activity which was its necessary
basis and which catered for all its caprices. In the most
cursory way Tacitus tells us that a great part of Italy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was gathered for the great fair at Cremona, on the fateful

Yet what a gathering it must have been! There were laid
out in the booths the fine woollens of Parma and Mutina, the
mantles of Canusium, the purples of Tarentum, the carpets
of Patavium. Traders from Ilva brought their iron wares,
Pompeii sent its fish sauces, and Lucania its famous sausages.
Nor would there be missing in the display the oil of Venafrum,
and the famous Setine and Falernian vintages.<a id="noteref_1468" name="noteref_1468" href="#note_1468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1468</span></span></a> The improvement
of the great roads in the reign of Trajan must have
given a vast stimulus to inland commerce. And we may be
sure that many a petty merchant with his pack was to be
seen along the Aemilian or Flaminian ways, like the travelling
vendor of honey and cheese, whom Lucius, in the tale of
Apuleius, meets hurrying to Hypata.<a id="noteref_1469" name="noteref_1469" href="#note_1469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1469</span></span></a> The great roads of

The colleges in which the artisans and traders of the
Antonine age grouped themselves are almost innumerable,
even in the records which time has spared. They represent
almost every conceivable branch of industry or special skill
or social service, from the men who laid the fine sand in the
arena, to the rich wine merchants of Lyons or Ostia.<a id="noteref_1484" name="noteref_1484" href="#note_1484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1484</span></span></a> The
mere catalogue of these associations in an index will give an
enlarged conception of the immense range and minute specialisation
of Roman industry. It may be doubted whether a
similar enumeration of our English crafts would be longer or
more varied. The great trades, which minister to the first
necessities of human life, occupy of course the largest space,
the bakers, the cloth-makers, the smiths, carpenters, and wood-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>merchants, trades often grouped together, the shoemakers
and fullers and carders of wool. The mechanics, who made
the arms and engines for the legions, naturally hold a
prominent place. Nor less prominent are the boatmen of
Ostia, and of the Rhone and the Saône.<a id="noteref_1485" name="noteref_1485" href="#note_1485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1485</span></span></a> The sailors of

citizens, men who have gained the whole series of municipal
honours, as their chiefs and patrons. Arles, which was
then a great sea-port, had its five corporations of sailor-folk,
and Ostia an equal number, charged with the momentous
task of taking up the cargoes of the African corn-ships for
the bakeries of Rome.<a id="noteref_1487" name="noteref_1487" href="#note_1487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1487</span></span></a> Transport by land is represented by

All the many trades and services which ministered to
the wants or pleasures of the capital were similarly banded
together, the actors and horn-blowers, the porters and paviors,
down to the humble dealers in pastils and salt fish.<a id="noteref_1489" name="noteref_1489" href="#note_1489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1489</span></span></a> We
have seen that even the gladiators, in their barrack-prisons,
were allowed to form their clubs. Although traces of these
combinations are found in remote and obscure places all
over the Roman world, it is at great commercial centres,
at Ostia, Puteoli, Lyons, and Rome itself, that they have
left the most numerous remains. They had probably for
one of their objects the protection of their members against
encroachments or fiscal oppression. Strabo once came across a
deputation of fishermen on their way to plead with the Emperor
for a reduction of their dues.<a id="noteref_1490" name="noteref_1490" href="#note_1490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1490</span></span></a> Yet it would be a mistake to
suppose that these trades unions were always organised for
trade objects, or that the separate colleges were composed of
people engaged in the same occupation. They had many
honorary members from among the richer classes, and, even
in the lower ranks, in defiance of the law,<a id="noteref_1491" name="noteref_1491" href="#note_1491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1491</span></span></a> a dealer in salt

been not so much the protection of their trade, as the cheer<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fulness of intercourse, the promotion of fellowship and good-will,

Probably no age, not even our own, ever felt a greater

and narrower than the State. It was a movement at which,

Thus it appears that in every part of the Roman world,
in the decaying little country town, and in the great trading
centres, the same great movement of association, is going
on apace. It swept into its current almost every social grade,
and every trade, handicraft or profession, the pastil-makers,
the green-grocers and unguent sellers of Rome, the muleteers
of the Alps, the fullers of Pompeii, the doctors at Beneventum,
the boatmen of the Seine, the wine merchants of Lyons. Men
formed themselves into these groups for the most trivial or
whimsical reasons, or for no reason at all, except that they
lived in the same quarter, and often met.<a id="noteref_1501" name="noteref_1501" href="#note_1501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1501</span></span></a> From the view
which the inscriptions give us of the interior of some of these
clubs, it is clear that their main purpose was social pleasure.
And this is especially true of the clubs of the humblest class.
M. Boissier has well remarked that the poor workman, the
poor freedman, with the brand of recent slavery upon him,
who was often engaged in some mean or disgusting occupation,
amidst a society which from tradition regarded any industry
soiled by servile touch with distant scorn, must have felt
themselves solitary exiles in the desert of a great town, the
most awful desert in the world. The remote splendour of the
court and aristocratic life must have deepened the gloom of
isolation and helplessness. Shut out for ever from that
brilliant world of fashion and pleasure and power, whose social
life seemed so charming and gay and friendly, the despised and
lonely toiler sought a refuge in little gatherings of people as
lonely as himself. At some chance meeting, some one, more
energetic than the rest, would throw out the suggestion to form
a club, on the model of some of the old trade societies which
had always been authorised by the State from the days of
Numa, or of those newer associations which were now tacitly
permitted under the guise of religion. A small entrance fee
would meet, for the time, their modest expenses. In that age
of generous or ambitious profusion, it was not hard to find
some influential patron, a kindly gracious noble, or an aspiring
or generous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span>, to give the infant society his countenance,
along with a substantial donation for the building of a club-house,
and for simple convivial pleasures on his birthday, and
other festivals which could easily be multiplied. Then the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>brethren met in solemn form to frame their constitution and
commemorate their benefactor, on one of those many monuments
which illuminate a social life on which the literature of
the age is generally silent.

The continuity and repetition of proved political organisation
is a notable characteristic of the great races which have
left, or are destined to leave, their mark on history. The
British settlers on the prairies of Oregon or Manitoba immediately
order themselves into communities, which are modelled
on a social system as old as the Heptarchy. The Latin
race had perhaps an even more stubborn conservatism than
the English. Under the most various circumstances, the
Roman instinctively clung to forms and institutions of tested
strength and elasticity, and consecrated by the immemorial
usage of his race. The most distant and most humble municipality
was fashioned after the pattern of the great <span class="tei tei-q">“city which
had become a world.”</span><a id="noteref_1502" name="noteref_1502" href="#note_1502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1502</span></span></a> It had its senate, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ordo splendidissimus
et amplissimus</span></span>, and the popular assembly which elected
the magistrates. The municipal magistrates, if they do not
always bear the ancient names, reproduce in shadowy form
the dictators, the praetors, the aediles, quaestors, and censors of
the old republic.<a id="noteref_1503" name="noteref_1503" href="#note_1503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1503</span></span></a> The same continuity of form is seen in the
colleges. As the municipal town was modelled on the constitution
of the State, so we may say that the college was modelled
on the municipal town. The college, indeed, became a city for
the brotherhood, at once a city and a home. They apply to it
such terms as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respublica collegii</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1504" name="noteref_1504" href="#note_1504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1504</span></span></a> The meetings often took place
in a temple, whether of a patron deity or of an emperor, as
those of the Roman Senate were held in the temple of Concord
or of Bellona. There they elected their administrative officers,
generally for a period of one year; in some cases, by way of
special distinction, for life. The heads of these little societies
bear various names, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magistri</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curatores</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quinquennales</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">praefecti</span></span>,

financial affairs, which, although perhaps on no great scale,
still involved the investment of trust moneys to yield the
prescribed amounts which had to be distributed either as burial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>payments, or in food and money on the high festivals. The
number of the members was generally limited, either by the
government in the interests of public order, or by the will of
a benefactor, to prevent the progressive diminution in the
value of the divisible shares of the income.<a id="noteref_1507" name="noteref_1507" href="#note_1507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1507</span></span></a> A periodical
revision of the roll of members was therefore conducted every
five years, as it was in the municipality, by the chief officers,
exercising for the time censorial powers in miniature. Fortunately
the albums of three or four colleges have been preserved.
The lists throw a vivid light on their constitution and social
tone. We have drawn attention in a former chapter to the
strict gradation of social rank in the city polity. The same
characteristic is repeated in the collegiate organisation. In these
humble plebeian coteries, composed of <span class="tei tei-q">“men without a grandfather,”</span>
of men, perhaps, whose father was a slave, or of men
who were slaves themselves, there emerges, to our astonishment,
a punctilious observance of shadowy social distinctions, which
is an inheritance from the exclusive aristocratic pride of the
old republic. This characteristic has excited in some French
critics and historians a certain admiration,<a id="noteref_1508" name="noteref_1508" href="#note_1508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1508</span></span></a> in which it is
not altogether easy to join. Gradation of rank to ensure
devotion and order in public service is a precious and admirable
thing. But artificial and unreal distinctions, invented and
conferred to flatter wealth, to stimulate or reward the largesses
of the rich patron, to gratify the vulgar self-complacency of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenu</span></span>, are only a degrading form of mendicancy. Some
indulgence is no doubt due to men who were still under the yoke
of slavery, or only just released from it; the iron had entered
into their souls. But both the college and the municipality
of the Antonine age cannot be relieved of the charge of
purchased or expectant deference to mere wealth. Hence we
cannot altogether share the pleasure of M. Boissier in these
pale and vulgar reproductions of the hierarchy of a real
aristocracy. But the image of the hierarchy is there, and it is
very instructive. In a college of smiths in Tarraconensis, there
were fifteen patrons at the head of the roll, followed by
twelve decurions, including two doctors and a soothsayer, one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>man isolated by the honours of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bisellium</span></span>, two honorary
members, twenty-eight plain plebeians. There were also several
<span class="tei tei-q">“mothers”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“daughters”</span> of the society.<a id="noteref_1509" name="noteref_1509" href="#note_1509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1509</span></span></a> The album of
another club at Ostia shows a list of nine patrons, two holders
of quinquennial rank, and one hundred and twenty-three
plebeians.<a id="noteref_1510" name="noteref_1510" href="#note_1510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1510</span></span></a> The plebs of many colleges included slaves, and
in more than one inscription the men of ingenuous and those
of servile birth are carefully distinguished, the slaves being
sometimes placed at the bottom of the roll.<a id="noteref_1511" name="noteref_1511" href="#note_1511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1511</span></span></a> Yet it was surely
a great advance when slaves and freemen could meet together
for the time, on a certain footing of equality, for business or
convivial intercourse. The rigid lines of old pagan society are
indeed still marked on the face of these clubs. And yet many
an inscription leaves the impression that these little societies
of the old pagan world are nurseries, in an imperfect way, of
the gentle charities and brotherliness which, in shy retirement,
the young Church was cultivating in her disciples to be
the ideal of the world.

These colleges became homes for the homeless, a little
fatherland, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patria</span></span>, for those without a country. Sometimes
they may have met in low taverns, which were on that
account jealously watched by some of the emperors.<a id="noteref_1512" name="noteref_1512" href="#note_1512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1512</span></span></a> But
they generally attained to the possession of a club-room or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">schola</span></span>, a name which had been previously given to the
lounging-room of the public baths. Sometimes the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">schola</span></span>
was erected at their own cost, the site being perhaps granted
by some rich patron, or by the town council, on a vacant
spot close to the basilica or the theatre.<a id="noteref_1513" name="noteref_1513" href="#note_1513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1513</span></span></a> But frequently a
hall was built for them by some generous friend. A like
generosity often provided for them a little chapel of their
patron deity, with a shaded court, or a balcony open to the
air and sun, where the brethren took their common meals.<a id="noteref_1514" name="noteref_1514" href="#note_1514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1514</span></span></a>
Or a rich patron, anxious to secure some care and religious
observance of his last resting-place, would bequeath to a
college a pleasant garden adjoining the tomb, with a house
in which to hold their meetings.<a id="noteref_1515" name="noteref_1515" href="#note_1515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1515</span></span></a> And, as a further security
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>against neglect and oblivion, a sum of 10,000 or 15,000
sesterces would be invested to provide a dinner for the
college on their benefactor’s birthday.<a id="noteref_1516" name="noteref_1516" href="#note_1516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1516</span></span></a> As years went on,
the scene of many a pleasant gathering became a centre
round which clustered a great deal of sentiment, and even
pride. We may imagine that, allowing for differences of
time and faith, the little school or shrine would, in the course
of years, attract something of the feeling which consecrates
an ancient village church in England, or a little Bethel which
was built in the year of the visit of John Wesley. It became
a point of honour to make gifts to the schola, to add to its
comfort or beauty. One benefactor would redeem a right of
ancient lights, or build a boundary wall.<a id="noteref_1517" name="noteref_1517" href="#note_1517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1517</span></span></a> Another would
make a present of bronze candelabra on a marble stand, with
the device of a Cupid holding baskets in his hands.<a id="noteref_1518" name="noteref_1518" href="#note_1518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1518</span></span></a> Or a
college would receive from its curator a gift of some silver
statues of the gods, on the dedication of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">schola</span></span>, with a
brass tablet, no doubt recording the event.<a id="noteref_1519" name="noteref_1519" href="#note_1519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1519</span></span></a> The gift of a
place where the brethren of the club might be buried beside
their wives or concubines, was probably, to these poor people,
not the least valued benefaction.<a id="noteref_1520" name="noteref_1520" href="#note_1520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1520</span></span></a> Many a humble donation
was probably made, which was too slight for a memorial.
But it happens that we have one record of gifts evidently
offered by poor, insignificant people. It is contained in a very
interesting inscription found upon a rock near the theatre at
Philippi in Macedonia.<a id="noteref_1521" name="noteref_1521" href="#note_1521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1521</span></span></a> It records that P. Hostilius Philadelphus,
in recognition of the aedileship of the college, which
had been conferred upon him, bore the expense of polishing
the rock, and inscribing upon it the names of the members of
a college of Silvanus, sixty-nine in number, together with a list
of those who had presented gifts to their temple. The college
was a religious one, with a priest who is named in the first
place. It is also a funerary society, and seems to be composed
of freedmen and of slaves, either belonging to the colony
or private masters. They had just erected a temple of their
patron god, to which some had given subscriptions in money,
while others made various offerings for its adornment. One
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>brother presents an image of the god in a little shrine, another
statuettes of Hercules and Mercury. There is another
donation of some stone-work in front of the temple, and
Hostilius, at his own expense, cut away the rock to smooth
the approach to the shrine. Most of the gifts are of trifling
value, a poor little picture worth 15 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">denarii</span></span>, a marble image
of Bacchus costing not much more. But they were the
offerings of an enthusiastic brotherhood, and the good Hostilius
has given them an immortality of which they never dreamed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The contributions of the members would generally have
been but a sorry provision for the social and religious life of a
college. Reproducing, as it did, the constitution and the tone
of the city in so many traits, the college in nothing follows
its model so closely as in its reliance on the generosity of
patronage. At the head of the album of the society there
is a list, sometimes disproportionately long, of its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">patroni</span></span>.
Countless inscriptions leave us in no doubt as to the reason
why the patron was elected. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d’être</span></span> in the
club is the same as in the city; it is to provide luxuries or
amusements for the society, which the society could not
generally obtain for itself. The relation of patron and client
is, of all the features of ancient life, the one which, being so
remote from the spirit of our democratic society, is perhaps
most difficult for us to understand. The mutual obligations,
enforced by a powerful traditional sentiment, were of the most
binding, and sometimes burdensome character. And in that
form of relation, between former master and freedman, which
became so common in the first age of the Empire, the old
master was bound to continue his support and protection to
the emancipated slave.<a id="noteref_1522" name="noteref_1522" href="#note_1522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1522</span></span></a> Although there was much that
was sordid and repulsive in the position of the client in
Juvenal’s and Martial’s days, we must still recognise the fact
that the fortune of the rich patron had to pay a heavy price
for social deference. Not less heavy was the demand made
on the patrons of municipalities and colleges.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There must have been wide distinctions of dignity and
importance among the industrial colleges of the Empire.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">centonarii</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fabri</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dendrophori</span></span> of the more
important centres, such as Aquileia, Lyons and Milan, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>boatmen of Arles or Ostia, would probably have looked
down with scorn on the flute-players of the Via Sacra, the
hunters of Corfinium, or the muleteers of the Porta Gallica.<a id="noteref_1523" name="noteref_1523" href="#note_1523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1523</span></span></a>
And there was a corresponding variety in the rank of the
patrons. Some are high officials of the Empire, procurators
of provinces, curators of great public works, or distinguished
officers of the legions. Or they are men evidently of high
position and commanding influence in their province, priests
of the altar of Augustus, augurs of the colony, magistrates
or decurions of two or three cities.<a id="noteref_1524" name="noteref_1524" href="#note_1524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1524</span></span></a> Sometimes the
patron is a great merchant, with warehouses of oil or wine
at Lyons or Tarragona or Ostia.<a id="noteref_1525" name="noteref_1525" href="#note_1525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1525</span></span></a> Yet in spite of his wealth,
the patron’s social position in those days might be rather
uncertain, and we may without difficulty, from modern
analogies, believe that a new man might find his vanity
soothed, or his position made less obscure, by being known
as the titular head of an ancient corporation of the clothworkers,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dendrophori</span></span>, or of the boatmen on the Saône.
Probably in obscure country towns, remote from the seat of
Empire, these bourgeois dignities were even more valued.<a id="noteref_1526" name="noteref_1526" href="#note_1526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1526</span></span></a> The
humbler colleges would have to be content with one of the new
freedmen, such as the vulgar friends of Trimalchio, who, after
a youth of shameful servitude, had leapt into fortune by
some happy chance or stroke of shrewdness, and who sought
a compensation for the contempt of the great world in the
deference and adulation of those who waited for their largesses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The election of a patron was an event of great moment,
especially to a poor college. And it was conducted with a
formal preciseness, and an assumption of dignity, which, at this
distance of time, are sometimes rather ludicrous. In a little town
of Cisalpine Gaul in the year 190, the college of smiths and
clothworkers met in solemn session in their temple. Their
quaestors, who may have had the financial condition of the
college in view, made a formal proposal that the college should
set an example of the judicious reward of merit, by electing
one Tutilius Julianus, a man distinguished by his modesty
and liberality, as the patron of their society. The meeting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>commended the sage proposal of the quaestors, and formally
resolved that the honourable Julianus should be requested
to accept the distinction, with an apology for so tardy a
recognition of his merits, and that a brass plate, containing a
copy of this decree, should be placed above his door.<a id="noteref_1527" name="noteref_1527" href="#note_1527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1527</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is significant that the patrons were, in very many cases,
Seviri and Augustales, a body which in the provinces, as we have
seen, was generally composed of new men of the freedman class.
Although they were steadily rising in importance and in strength
of organisation, the provincial Augustales always ranked after
the decurions of a town. They often displayed boundless
liberality to their city and to their own order.<a id="noteref_1528" name="noteref_1528" href="#note_1528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1528</span></span></a> But the
leading Augustales seem to have been quite as generous to the
other corporations who placed themselves under their patronage.
And they were not unfrequently patrons of several colleges.<a id="noteref_1529" name="noteref_1529" href="#note_1529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1529</span></span></a>
It is no long task to find men who were the titular protectors
of two or three, of eight, or even of as many as twelve or
fifteen colleges. One inscription to Cn. Sentius of Ostia would
seem to include among his dependents almost every industrial
college in that busy port.<a id="noteref_1530" name="noteref_1530" href="#note_1530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1530</span></span></a> Sentius must have been a very
wealthy and a very generous man to accept the patronage of
so many societies, which in those days expected or demanded
that their honours should be paid for in solid cash. The
crowning distinction of a statue, or a durable inscription, was
often solemnly decreed with all seemly forms of deference or
unstinted flattery in a full meeting of the society. But in a
great majority of cases we are amused or disgusted to read
that, after all his other liberalities, the benefactor or his heir
is permitted to pay for the record of popular gratitude.<a id="noteref_1531" name="noteref_1531" href="#note_1531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1531</span></span></a> This
fact may explain the extraordinary abundance of these honours,
if it somewhat lowers their value in the eyes of posterity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, besides the benefactions which sprang either from
ambition or real generosity, a vast number were inspired by the
Roman passion for long remembrance, and for the continuity
of funerary ritual. The very position of so many tombs by
the side of the great roads beyond the city gates, was a silent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>appeal to the passing traveller not to forget the departed. The
appeal is also often expressly made on the stone by those who
had no other means of prolonging their own memory or that of
some one they loved. It is impossible to read without some
emotion the prayer of an old Spanish soldier, that his brethren
of the college may never suffer grief like his, if they will only
keep the lamp burning for ever over the tomb of his child.<a id="noteref_1532" name="noteref_1532" href="#note_1532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1532</span></span></a> The

tomb a field or gardens of considerable extent, to be cultivated
for profit, or to bear the roses for the annual offering.
The whole area, the dimensions of which, in many inscriptions,
are defined with mathematical precision, would be surrounded
by a wall. Within the enclosure there would be a little
shrine containing statues of the dead, an arbour and a well, and
a hall in which the kindred of coming generations might hold
their annual banquet, till the tie was dissolved by the cruel oblivion
of time.<a id="noteref_1534" name="noteref_1534" href="#note_1534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1534</span></span></a> There will be a cottage (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">taberna</span></span>) in which a freedman

feels, were likely to be defeated in the end by the vicissitudes
of human fortunes.<a id="noteref_1536" name="noteref_1536" href="#note_1536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1536</span></span></a> He had, indeed, before his eyes the fate
of many a forsaken and forgotten tomb of old worthies of the
Republic. Families die out; faithful freedmen and their children
cannot keep their watch for ever. The garden will grow
wild, a time may come when no kindly hand will pour the
libation or scatter the roses on the natal day. Families will die
out, but a college may go on for ever by the perpetual renewal
of its members. Inspired with this idea, a worthy of Nîmes
created a funerary college to dine regularly in his honour.<a id="noteref_1537" name="noteref_1537" href="#note_1537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1537</span></span></a>
It was to consist of thirty persons, and the number was
to be maintained by co-optation into the places of deceased
members. Members of the college who were obliged to be
absent might send one of their friends to join in the repast.
Thus the dead man, who had taken such care to prolong his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>memory, would at no distant date be festively celebrated by
people who barely knew his name. Many another left a
bequest to a college to be spent in a feast on the testator’s
memorial day.<a id="noteref_1538" name="noteref_1538" href="#note_1538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1538</span></span></a> A freedman of Mevania leaves a tiny

more liberal provision for convivial enjoyment was left to
a college of Silvanus in honour of Domitian. It consisted
of the rents of four estates, with their appurtenances, which
were to be spent on the birthdays of the emperor and his
wife, <span class="tei tei-q">“for all time to come,”</span> with the sacrifices proper to
such a holy season.<a id="noteref_1540" name="noteref_1540" href="#note_1540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1540</span></span></a> Due provision is often made for the
seemly and impressive performance of a rite which was at
once a religious duty and a convivial pleasure. There is
a curious letter of the time of Antoninus Pius containing a
deed of gift to the college of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fabri</span></span> at Narbo, in return for
their constant favours to the donor. One Sextus Fadius
presents them with the sum of 16,000 sesterces, the interest
of which is to be divided every year at the end of April for
ever, at a banquet on his birthday; the guests on this festive
occasion are to be habited in their handsomest attire.<a id="noteref_1541" name="noteref_1541" href="#note_1541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1541</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the fullest and minutest arrangements for these modest
meals are to be found in the document relating to the foundation
of the poor college of Diana and Antinous, to which reference
has already been made. The master of the feast was taken in
regular order from the roll of the society. Each brother had to
accept this office in his turn, or pay a fine of five shillings of our
money. The regular festivals of the club were six in the year,
on the natal days of Diana and Antinous, and those of the
founder and some of his relatives. There is some obscurity in
the regulations for these common feasts, and at first sight they
are a ludicrous contrast to the pontiff’s famous banquet in the
days of Julius Caesar, described by Macrobius.<a id="noteref_1542" name="noteref_1542" href="#note_1542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1542</span></span></a> M. Boissier
naturally refuses to imagine that even the poor brethren of the
club of Diana and Antinous would be contented with bread,
four sardines, a bottle of good wine, with hot water and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>proper table service. The slave steward of Horace probably
found much better fare in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">popina</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1543" name="noteref_1543" href="#note_1543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1543</span></span></a> Dr. Mommsen has
resolved the mystery. It is evident, from several inscriptions,
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sportulae</span></span> were sharply distinguished from distributions of
bread and wine.<a id="noteref_1544" name="noteref_1544" href="#note_1544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1544</span></span></a> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sportula</span></span> was a gift of richer food or
dainties, which in public distributions might be carried home;
it was sometimes an equivalent in money. If those who
received the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sportula</span></span> preferred to enjoy it at a common table,
an appointed member of the college would have the food
prepared, or convert the money into dishes for the feast. The
bread and wine he might add from his own pocket, if they were
not provided by the foundation. How much for these meals
came from the club funds, and how much out of the pocket of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magister coenae</span></span>, is not always clearly stated. But we may
be sure, from the tone of the times, that additions to a modest
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">menu</span></span> were often made by the generosity of patrons and officers
of the club.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be futile and uninteresting to pursue into all its
minute details throughout the inscriptions, the system of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sportulae</span></span> founded by so many patrons and benefactors. Any
one who wishes can temperately regale himself for hours at
these shadowy club-feasts of the second century. Perhaps
the clearest example of such distributions is the donation of
Marcellina and Aelius Zeno to the little college of Aesculapius,
to which reference has been made for another purpose.<a id="noteref_1545" name="noteref_1545" href="#note_1545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1545</span></span></a> On
seven different anniversaries and festivals, sums of money, with
bread and wine, were distributed to the brethren of the college
in due proportions, according to their official dignity and social
rank. Thus, in the division on the 4th of November, the fête-day
of the society, the shares in money, according to the various
grades, from the father of the college downwards, are six, four,
and two. The division of the wine, according to social rank,
follows the proportion of nine, six, and three. A slightly different
scale is followed on the birthday of the Emperor Antoninus
Pius in September, and on the day for New Year’s gifts in
January. But in these benefactions the difference of grade is
always observed, the patron and the chief magistrates and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>magnates of the society always receiving a larger share than
the obscure brethren at the bottom of the list. In the college
of Aesculapius, Marcellina herself, and Aelius Zeno, the two
great benefactors of the society, along with the highest of its
dignitaries, are allotted three times as much as the plebeian
brother. The excellent Marcellina, who, in the fourth century
might perhaps have followed S. Jerome and Paula to Bethlehem,
was the widow of a good and tender husband, who had been
curator of the imperial picture galleries.<a id="noteref_1546" name="noteref_1546" href="#note_1546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1546</span></span></a> Had she been drawn
into the ranks of that hidden society, who were beginning to
lay their dead in the winding vaults beneath the Appian Way,
she would certainly have dealt out her bounty on a different
scale and on different principles. Her bequest to the college
of Aesculapius reveals how deep in the soul of a charitable
pagan woman, who was probably sprung from servile stock,
lay that aristocratic instinct of the Roman world which survived
the advent of the Divine Peasant and the preaching of the
fishermen of Galilee, for far more than four hundred years.

The most curious and interesting among the regulations for
these club entertainments are those relating to order and
decorum. The club of Diana and Antinous was not very
select, being probably composed of poor freedmen and slaves.<a id="noteref_1547" name="noteref_1547" href="#note_1547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1547</span></span></a>
The manners of this class, if we may judge by the picture
given by Petronius, were, to say the least, wanting in reserve
and self-restraint. The great object of such reunions was, as
the founder tells us, that the brethren might dine together
cheerfully and quietly.<a id="noteref_1548" name="noteref_1548" href="#note_1548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1548</span></span></a> Hence he most wisely orders that
all serious proposals and complaints shall be reserved for
business meetings. If any member quits his place or makes
a disturbance, he is to pay a fine of four sesterces. Twelve
sesterces is the penalty for insulting a fellow-guest. The
man who, under the influence of good wine, so far forgot
himself as to insult the chief officer of the society, was to be
punished by a forfeit of twenty sesterces, which would probably
be a powerful discouragement of bad manners to most of the
brotherhood of Antinous.

The motives are singularly uniform—to repay the honours conferred
by a college, to celebrate the dedication of a statue, to
save from forgetfulness a name which to us is only a bit of the
wreckage of time. Everything is conventional about these bequests.
The money is nearly always left for the same purpose,
an anniversary repast in honour of the humble dead, of the
emperor, or of the patron gods. Sometimes the burial fee is
refunded to the college, with the prayer that on the natal
day the poor pittance derived from the gift be spent on pious
rites, with roses strewn upon the grave.<a id="noteref_1549" name="noteref_1549" href="#note_1549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1549</span></span></a> Another will beg only
that the lamp in the humble vault may be kept for ever burning.
These pieties and longings, which have their roots in a
rude pagan past before the dawn of history, were destined to
prolong their existence far into Christian times. The lamp
will be kept burning over many a tomb of saint or martyr in
the fourth or fifth century. And the simple feasts which the
clothworkers of Brescia, or the boatmen of Ostia or Lyons,
observed to do honour to some departed patron, will be
celebrated, often in riotous fashion, over the Christian dead
in the days of S. Augustine and S. Paulinus of Nola.<a id="noteref_1550" name="noteref_1550" href="#note_1550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1550</span></span></a>

Dr. Mommsen believes that the collegiate life which blossomed
forth so luxuriantly in the early Empire, was modelled
on the sacred union of the Roman family.<a id="noteref_1551" name="noteref_1551" href="#note_1551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1551</span></span></a> And the instinct
of the Roman nature for continuity in institutions prepossesses
us in favour of the theory. In the college endowed by
Marcellina and Zeno, there are a father and a mother, and elsewhere
we read of daughters of a college. The members sometimes
call themselves brethren and sisters.<a id="noteref_1552" name="noteref_1552" href="#note_1552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1552</span></span></a> One of the feasts
of the brotherhood is on the day sacred to <span class="tei tei-q">“dear kinship,”</span> when
relations gathered round a common table, to forget in kindly
intercourse any disturbance of affection.<a id="noteref_1553" name="noteref_1553" href="#note_1553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1553</span></span></a> They also met in the
early days of January, when presents were exchanged. Above
all, like the primal society, they gathered on the birthdays of
the revered dead to whom they owed duty and remembrance.
And in many cases the members of the society reposed beside
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one another in death.<a id="noteref_1554" name="noteref_1554" href="#note_1554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1554</span></span></a> The college was a home of fraternal
equality in one sense. As M. Boissier has pointed out, the
members had equal rights in the full assembly of the club.
A quorum was needed to pass decrees and to elect the officers.
And, in the full conclave, the slave member had an equal voice
with the freeman, and might, perchance, himself even be elected
to a place of dignity.<a id="noteref_1555" name="noteref_1555" href="#note_1555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1555</span></span></a> He might thus, in a very humble realm,
wield authority for the time over those who were accustomed
to despise him. It is true that he needed his master’s leave
to join a college, and his master had the legal power to deny
to him the last boon of burial by the hands of his collegiate
brethren.<a id="noteref_1556" name="noteref_1556" href="#note_1556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1556</span></span></a> Yet it was undoubtedly a great stride in advance
when a slave could sit at table or in council on equal terms
with free-born men, and might receive pious Roman burial,
instead of being tossed like a piece of carrion into a nameless
grave. The society of one of these humble colleges must
have often for the moment relieved the weariness and misery
of the servile life, and awakened, or kept alive, some sense
of self-respect and dignity. The slave may have now and
then felt himself even on the edge of political influence, as
when his college placarded its sympathies in an election contest
on the walls of Pompeii. Yet we must not allow ourselves to
be deceived by words and appearances. In spite of legislative
reform, in spite of a growing humane sentiment, whether in the
Porch or the Christian Church, the lot of the slave and of the
poor plebeian will be in many respects as hopeless and degraded
in the reign of Honorius as it was in the reign of Trajan.<a id="noteref_1557" name="noteref_1557" href="#note_1557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1557</span></span></a> Even
in the reign of Trajan, it is true, perhaps even in the reign of
Nero, there were great houses like the younger Pliny’s, where
the slaves were treated as humble friends, where their weddings
were honoured by the presence of the master, where, in spite
of legal disabilities, they were allowed to dispose of their
savings by will.<a id="noteref_1558" name="noteref_1558" href="#note_1558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1558</span></span></a> And the inscriptions record the gratitude
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and affection to their masters and mistresses of many who
were in actual slavery, or who had but just emerged from it.
But these instances cannot make us forget the cruel contempt
and barbarity of which the slave was still the victim, and
which was to be his lot for many generations yet to run. And
therefore the improvement in the condition of the slave or of
his poor plebeian brother by the theoretical equality in the
colleges, may be easily exaggerated. In the humblest of these
clubs, the distribution of good fare and money is not according
to the needs of the members, but regulated by their social
and official rank. We cannot feel confident that in social
intercourse the same distinction may not have been coldly
observed. In modern times we often see a readiness to accord
an equality of material enjoyment, along with a stiff guardianship
of social distinctions which are often microscopic to
the detached observer. And it would not be surprising to
discover that the <span class="tei tei-q">“master”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“mother”</span> of the college of
Antinous protected their dignity by an icy reserve at its
festive meetings.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question has been raised whether the ordinary colleges
were in any sense charitable institutions for mutual help. And
certainly the inscriptions are singularly wanting in records of
bequests made directly for the relief of poverty, for widows and
orphans or the sick. The donations or bequests of rich patrons
seem to have had chiefly two objects in view, the commemoration
of the dead and the provision for social and convivial enjoyment.
It is true that, just as in municipal feasts, there is often a distribution
of money among the members of colleges. But this
appears to be deprived of an eleemosynary character by the
fact that by far the largest shares are assigned to those who
were presumably the least in need of them. Yet it is to be
recollected that we probably have left to us the memorial of
only a small proportion of these gifts, and that, if we had a full
list of all the benefactions bequeathed to some of the colleges,
the total amount received by each member in the year might
be very considerable, if judged by the standard of ordinary
plebeian incomes. To the ambitious slave any addition, however
small, to his growing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">peculium</span></span>, which might enable him
to buy his freedom, would certainly be grateful.

There is one class of colleges, however, which were
un<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>doubtedly formed to meet various exigencies in the course of
life, as well as to make a provision for decent burial. These
are the military clubs, on the objects and constitution of which
a flood of light has been thrown by the study of the inscriptions
in the great legionary camps of North Africa.<a id="noteref_1559" name="noteref_1559" href="#note_1559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1559</span></span></a> A passage

well known that, on the accession of each new emperor, or
on the occurrence of some interesting event in the history of
the prince’s family, or of some great military success, and often
without any particular justification, a donative was distributed
throughout the army. It sometimes reached a considerable
amount, ranging from the 25 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">denarii</span></span> granted by Vespasian,
to the 5000 of M. Aurelius.<a id="noteref_1561" name="noteref_1561" href="#note_1561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1561</span></span></a> One half of this largess was
by orders set aside, and retained under the custody of the
standard-bearers, to provide a pension on the soldier’s retirement
from the service. Another fund, entirely different, was
formed by the soldiers’ own contributions, to furnish a decent
burial for those who died on service. But the law against
the formation of colleges fell with peculiar severity on the
soldier.<a id="noteref_1562" name="noteref_1562" href="#note_1562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1562</span></span></a> Not even for a religious purpose was he permitted

Lambaesis, as we have seen, was one of those camps which
developed into a regular municipality, after the recognition of
soldiers’ marriages by Septimius Severus. Henceforth the
camp became only a place of drill and exercise, and ceased to
be the soldier’s home. And on the ground where the soldiers’
huts used to stand, there are left the remains of a number of
buildings of the basilica shape, erected probably in the third
century, which were the club-houses of the officers of the Tertia
Augusta. The interior was adorned with statues of imperial
personages, and on the wall was inscribed the law of the college,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>commencing with an expression of gratitude for the very
liberal pay which enabled the college to make provision for

ways. An ambitious young officer was allowed a liberal
viaticum for a journey across the sea to seek promotion. If
promotion came, he received another grant to equip him. One
half the amount granted in these cases was mercifully paid to
him in the unpleasant contingency of his losing his grade. If
he died on active service, his heir received a payment on the
larger scale. And, when a man, in due course, retired from
the army, he received the same sum under the name of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">anularium</span></span>, which has puzzled the antiquary.<a id="noteref_1566" name="noteref_1566" href="#note_1566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1566</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been maintained that these military clubs were
really and primarily funerary societies.<a id="noteref_1567" name="noteref_1567" href="#note_1567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1567</span></span></a> And provision for
burial was certainly one of their objects. Yet, on a reading
of the law of the society of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cornicines</span></span>, it may be doubted
whether the subject of burial is more prominent than the
other contingencies of the officer’s life, and in some of the
inscriptions, burial is not even alluded to. The grant on
retirement or promotion, and the grant to his heir on the
death of a member, are the same. But probably the majority
of officers had the good fortune to carry the money with
them into peaceful retirement, if not into higher rank in
another corps. In this case they would probably join another
college, whether of soldiers or veterans, and secure once more
the all-important object of a decent and pious interment.
The military clubs seem rather intended to furnish an insurance
against the principal risks and occasions of expenditure
in a soldier’s career. A calculation shows that, after providing
for all these liabilities, the military college must have had a
considerable surplus.<a id="noteref_1568" name="noteref_1568" href="#note_1568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1568</span></span></a> How it was spent, it is not hazardous
to conjecture. If the poor freedmen and slaves at Ostia
or Lanuvium could afford their modest meals, with a fair
allowance of good wine, drunk to the memory of a generous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>benefactor, we may be sure that the college of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cornicines</span></span>
at Lambesi would relieve the tedium of the camp by many
a pleasant mess dinner, and that they would have been
astonished and amused on such occasions to hear themselves
described merely as a burial society.

The foundation law of the college of Diana and Antinous

in reading these records of a futile effort to prolong the
memory of obscure lives, to know how long the brotherhoods
continued their meetings, or when the stated offerings of wine
and flowers ceased to be made. In one case the curiosity is
satisfied and we have before our eyes the formal record of the
extinction of a college. It is contained in a pair of wooden
tablets found in some quarry pits near Alburnus, a remote
village of Dacia. The document was drawn up, as the names
of the consuls show, in the year 167, the year following the
fierce irruption of the Quadi and Marcomanni into Dacia,

in the mastership has never set foot in Alburnus since
his election. The accounts have been wound up, and no balance
is left in the chest. For a long time no member has attended
on the days fixed for meetings, and, as a matter of course, no
subscriptions have been paid. All this is expressed in the
rudest, most ungrammatical Latin, and Artemidorus quaintly
concludes by saying, that, if a member has just died, he must
not imagine that he has any longer a college or any claim to
funeral payments! The humble brothers of the society, whom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Artemidorus reproaches for their faithless negligence, may

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Philosophy in the time of Seneca was a very different thing
from the great cosmic systems of Ionia and Magna Graecia,
or even from the system of the older Stoicism. Speculative
interest had long before his time given way to the study of
moral problems with a definite practical aim. If the stimulus
of the searching method of Socrates gave an impetus for a
century to abstract speculation, it had an even more decided
and long-lived influence in diverting thought to moral questions
from the old ambitious paths. His disciples Antisthenes
and Aristippus prepared the way for the Stoic and Epicurean
schools which dominated the Roman world in the last century
of the Republic and the first of the Empire. And even Plato
and Aristotle indirectly helped forward the movement. It is
not merely that, for both these great spirits, the cultivation of
character and the reform of society have a profound interest.
But even in their metaphysics, they were paving the way for
the more introspective and practical turn which was taken by
post-Aristotelian philosophy, by giving to what were mere
conceptions of the mind a more real existence than to the
things of sense.<a id="noteref_1571" name="noteref_1571" href="#note_1571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1571</span></span></a> The <span class="tei tei-q">“ideas”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“forms”</span> which they contrast
with the world of concrete things, are really creations of the
individual mind of which the reality must be sought in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>depths of consciousness, however they may be divinised and
elevated to some transcendental region beyond the limits of
sense and time. With Aristotle, as with Plato, in the last
resort, the higher reason is the true essence of man, coming
into the body from a diviner world, and capable of lifting
itself to the ideal from the cramping limitations of sensuous
life. The philosopher in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span> who turns his gaze
persistently from the confusing phantasmagoria of the senses
to that realm of real existence, eternal and immutable, of
which he has once had a vision, is really the distant progenitor
of the sage of Stoicism, who cuts himself off from the external
objects of desire, to find within a higher law, and the peace
which springs from a life in harmony with the Reason of the
world.

The ancient schools, if they maintained a formal individuality
even to the days of Justinian,<a id="noteref_1572" name="noteref_1572" href="#note_1572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1572</span></span></a> had worked themselves
out. A host of scholarchs, from all the cities of the Greek
East, failed to break fresh ground, and were content to guard
the most precious or the least vulnerable parts of an ancient
tradition. Moreover, the scrutiny of the long course of speculation,
issuing in such various conclusions, with no criterion
to decide between their claims, gave birth to a scepticism
which sheltered itself even under the great name of the
Academy. And as the faith in the truth of systems dwindled,
the marks of demarcation between them faded; men were less
inclined to dogmatise, and began to select and combine
elements from long discordant schools. In this movement the
eclectic and the sceptic had very much the same object in view—the
support and culture of the individual moral life.<a id="noteref_1573" name="noteref_1573" href="#note_1573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1573</span></span></a> The
sceptic sought his ideal in restrained suspense of judgment
and in moral calm. The eclectic, without regard to speculative
consistency, and with only a secondary interest in speculation,
sought for doctrines from any quarter which provided a basis

The extinction of the free civic life of Greece, the conquests
of Macedon, the foundation of the world-wide empire of Rome,
had wrought a momentous moral change. In the old city-state,
religion, morals, and political duty were linked in a
gracious unity and harmony. The citizen drew moral support
and inspiration from ancestral laws and institutions clothed
with almost divine authority. Even Plato does not break
away from the old trammels, but requires the elders of his
Utopia as a duty, after they have seen the vision of God,
to descend again to the ordinary tasks of government. But
when the corporate life which supplied such vivid interests
and moral support was wrecked, the individual was thrown
back upon himself. Morals were finally separated from
politics. Henceforth the great problem of philosophy was
how to make character self-sufficing and independent; how to
find the beatitude of man in the autonomous will, fenced
against all assaults of chance and change.<a id="noteref_1575" name="noteref_1575" href="#note_1575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1575</span></span></a> At the same
time, the foundation of great monarchies, Macedonian or Roman,
embracing many tribes and races and submerging old civic or
national barriers, brought into clearer light the idea of a universal
commonwealth, and placed morals on the broad foundation
of a common human nature and universal brotherhood.
The mundane city of old days, which absorbed, perhaps too
completely, the moral life and conscience of her sons, has
vanished for ever. And in its place and over its ruins has
risen an all-embracing power which seems to have all the
sweep of an impersonal force of nature, though it is sometimes
impelled by one wild, lawless will. If, in return for the loss
of civic freedom, ambitious and patriotic energy, or pride of
civic life, it has given to its subjects a marvellous peace and
order and culture, have not the mass of men become grosser
and more materialised? If there is greater material well-being
and better administration, have not the moral tone and
ideal, in the lack of stimulus, been lowered? Has not vice
become more shameless, and the greed for all things pleasant
grown harder and more cruel? Are not the mass of men
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hopelessly and wearily wandering in a tangled maze without

With such questionings ringing in his inner ear, the man
with some lingering instinct of goodness might well crave,
beyond anything else, for an inner law of life which should
bring order into the chaos of his conduct and desires.<a id="noteref_1577" name="noteref_1577" href="#note_1577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1577</span></span></a> And
philosophy, having in magnificent effort failed to scale the
virgin heights, fell back on conduct, which seemed then, even
more than to a lost teacher of our youth, <span class="tei tei-q">“three-fourths of
life.”</span> The great science which, in the glory and fresh vigour
of the Hellenic prime, aspired to embrace all existence and all
knowledge, to penetrate the secret of the universe and God,
by general consent narrowed its efforts to relieve the struggles
of this transient life set <span class="tei tei-q">“between two eternities.”</span> The
human spirit, weary of the fruitless quest of an ever-vanishing
ideal of knowledge, took up the humbler task of solving the
ever-recurring problem of human happiness and conduct.
Henceforth, in spite of traditional dialectic discordance, all the
schools, Stoic or Epicurean, Sceptic or Eclectic, are seeking for
the secret of inner peace, and are singularly unanimous in their

of phrase. What has he to do with any single state who
realises his citizenship in the great commonwealth of man? If
the secret of peace cannot be won by launching in adventurous
thought into the Infinite, perchance it may be found in discipline
of the rebellious will. Philosophy, then, must become the guide
of life, the healer of spiritual maladies.<a id="noteref_1579" name="noteref_1579" href="#note_1579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1579</span></span></a> It must teach the

This serious aim of philosophy commended itself to the
intensely practical and strenuous spirit of the Romans. And
although there were plenty of showy lecturers or preachers in
the first century who could draw fashionable audiences, the
private philosophic director was a far more real power. The
triumph of Aemilius Paulus brought numbers of Greek exiles
to Italy, many of whom found a home as teachers in Roman

Aemilianus, in whose house he lived. Great generals and

often carried philosophers in their train. From Augustus to

Of this great movement to cultivate a moral life in paganism
L. Annaeus Seneca was not the least illustrious representative.
Musonius, his younger contemporary, and Epictetus, the pupil
of Musonius, were engaged in the same cure of souls, and
taught practically the same philosophic gospel. They equally
paid but slight attention to the logic and physics of the older
schools.<a id="noteref_1591" name="noteref_1591" href="#note_1591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1591</span></span></a> Virtue, to all of them, is the one great end of philosophic
effort. They were all deeply impressed by the spiritual
wants of the time,<a id="noteref_1592" name="noteref_1592" href="#note_1592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1592</span></span></a> and they all felt that men needed not
subtleties of disquisition or rhetorical display, but direct, personal
teaching which appealed to the conscience. To all of them
the philosopher is a physician of souls. Musonius and Epictetus
were probably loftier and more blameless characters than
Seneca. Epictetus especially, from the range and simple
attractiveness of his teaching, might seem to many a better representative
of the philosophic director than Seneca. Seneca,
as the wealthy minister of Nero, excites a repugnance in some
minds, which prevents them doing justice to his unquestionable
power and fascination. His apparent inconsistency has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>condemned him in the eyes of an age which professes to believe
in the teaching of the Mount, and idolises grandiose wealth
and power. His rhetoric offends a taste that can tolerate and
applaud verbose banalities, with little trace of redeeming art.
He cannot always win the hearing accorded to the repentant
sinner, whose dark experience may make his message more
real and pungent. The historian, however, must put aside
these rather pharisaic prejudices, and give Seneca the position
as a moral teacher which his writings have won in ages not
less earnest than ours. Nor need we fear to recognise a power
which led the early Fathers to trace the spiritual vision of
Seneca to an intercourse with S. Paul,<a id="noteref_1593" name="noteref_1593" href="#note_1593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1593</span></span></a> supported by a feigned
correspondence which imposed on S. Augustine and S. Jerome.<a id="noteref_1594" name="noteref_1594" href="#note_1594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1594</span></span></a>
The man who approaches Seneca thinking only of scandals
gleaned from Tacitus and Dion Cassius,<a id="noteref_1595" name="noteref_1595" href="#note_1595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1595</span></span></a> and frozen by a criticism
which cannot feel the power of genius, spiritual imagination, and
a profound moral experience, behind a rhetoric sometimes forced
and extravagant, had better leave him alone. The Christianity
of the twentieth century might well hail with delight the
advent of such a preacher, and would certainly forget all the
accusations of prurient gossip in the accession of an immense
and fascinating spiritual force. The man with any historical
imagination must be struck with amazement that such spiritual
detachment, such lofty moral ideals, so pure an enthusiasm for
the salvation of souls, should emerge from a palace reeking
with all the crimes of the haunted races of Greek legend.
That the courtier of the reigns of Caligula and Claudius, the
tutor and minister of Nero, should not have escaped some
stains may be probable: that such a man should have composed
the Letters and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Ira</span></span> of Seneca is almost a miracle. Yet
the glow of earnestness and conviction, the intimate knowledge
of the last secrets of guilty souls, may well have been the
reward of such an ordeal.

Seneca’s career, given a latent fund of moral enthusiasm,
was really a splendid preparation for his mission, as an analyst
of a corrupt society and a guide to moral reform. He lived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>through the gloomiest years of the imperial tyranny; he had
been in the thick of its intrigues, and privy to its darkest
secrets; he had enjoyed its favour, and knew the perils of
its jealousy and suspicion. He came as an infant from
Cordova to Rome in the last years of Augustus.<a id="noteref_1596" name="noteref_1596" href="#note_1596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1596</span></span></a> In spite of
weak health, he was an ardent student of all the science and

Sotion, a member of the Sextian School, which combined a
rigorous Stoicism with Pythagorean rules of life.<a id="noteref_1597" name="noteref_1597" href="#note_1597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1597</span></span></a> As a young

Corsica was the penalty of a supposed intrigue with Julia, the
niece of the emperor.<a id="noteref_1600" name="noteref_1600" href="#note_1600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1600</span></span></a> Seneca knew how to bend to the storm,

famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quinquennium</span></span>, an oasis in the desert of despotism, was

gardens and villas and lordly state of the great minister, suggested
a possible aspirant to the principate. Seneca acted on

Seneca was an ideal director for the upper class of such an
age. He had risen to the highest office in a world-wide
monarchy, and he had spent years in hourly fear of death.
He had enjoyed the society of the most brilliant circles, and
exchanged epigrams and repartees with the best; he had also
seen them steeped in debauchery and treachery, and terror-stricken
in base compliance. He had witnessed their fantastic
efforts of luxury and self-indulgence, and heard the tale of
wearied sensualism and disordered ambition and ineffectual
lives.<a id="noteref_1608" name="noteref_1608" href="#note_1608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1608</span></span></a> His disciples were drawn, if not from the noblest class,
at any rate from the class which had felt the disillusionment
of wealth and fashion and power. And the vicissitudes in his
own fate and character made him a powerful and sympathetic
adviser. He had long to endure the torturing contrast of
splendid rank and wealth, with the brooding terror of a doom
which might sweep down at any moment. He was also tortured
by other contrasts, some drawn by the fierceness of envious
hatred, others perhaps acknowledged by conscience. Steeped in
the doctrines of Chrysippus and Pythagoras, he had subdued
the ebullient passions of youth by a more than monastic asceticism.<a id="noteref_1609" name="noteref_1609" href="#note_1609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1609</span></span></a>
He had passionately adopted an ethical creed which
aimed at a radical reform of human nature, at the triumph of
cultivated and moralised reason and social sympathy over the
brutal materialism and selfishness of the age. He had pondered
on its doctrines of the higher life, of the nothingness of the
things of sense, on death, and the indwelling God assisting
the struggling soul, on the final happy release from all the
sordid misery and terror, until every earthly pleasure and
ambition faded away in the presence of a glorious moral ideal.<a id="noteref_1610" name="noteref_1610" href="#note_1610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1610</span></span></a>
And yet this pagan monk, this idealist, who would have been
at home with S. Jerome or Thomas à Kempis, had accumulated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a vast fortune, and lived in a palace which excited the envy
of a Nero. He was suspected of having been the lover of two
princesses of the imperial house.<a id="noteref_1611" name="noteref_1611" href="#note_1611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1611</span></span></a> He was charged with having

apologist.<a id="noteref_1612" name="noteref_1612" href="#note_1612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1612</span></span></a> Some of these rumours are probably false, the work
of prurient imaginations in the most abandoned age in history.
Yet there are traces in Seneca’s writings that he had not
passed unscathed through the terrible ordeal to which character
was exposed in that age. There are pictures of voluptuous
ease and jaded satiety which may be the work of a keen sympathetic
observation, but which may also be the expression of
repentant memory.<a id="noteref_1613" name="noteref_1613" href="#note_1613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1613</span></span></a> In any case, he had sounded the very
depths of the moral abysses of his time. He had no illusions
about the actual condition of human nature. The mass of
men, all but a few naturally saintly souls, were abandoned to
lust or greed or selfish ambition. Human life was an obscene
and cruel struggle of wild beasts for the doles flung by fortune
into the arena.<a id="noteref_1614" name="noteref_1614" href="#note_1614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1614</span></span></a> The peace and happiness of the early Eden
have departed for ever, leaving men to the restlessness of
exhausted appetite, or to the half-repentant sense of impotent
lives, spent in pursuing the phantoms of imaginary pleasure,
with broken glimpses now and then of a world for ever lost.<a id="noteref_1615" name="noteref_1615" href="#note_1615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1615</span></span></a>
With such a scene about him in his declining years, whatever
his own practice may have been, Seneca came to feel an
evangelistic passion, almost approaching S. Paul’s, to open to
these sick perishing souls the vision of a higher life through
the practical discipline of philosophy.

The tendency to regard the true function of philosophy as
purely ethical, reforming, guiding and sustaining character and
conduct, finds its most emphatic expression in Seneca. He is
far more a preacher, a spiritual director, than a thinker, and he
would have proudly owned it. His highest, nay, one may
almost say his only aim, is, in our modern phrase, to which
his own sometimes approaches, to save souls. Philosophy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in its highest and best sense is not the pursuit of knowledge

life. He has become the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">generis humani paedagogus</span></span>,<a id="noteref_1619" name="noteref_1619" href="#note_1619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1619</span></span></a> the
schoolmaster to bring men to the Ideal Man. In comparison
with that mission, all the sublimity or subtlety of the great
masters of dialectic becomes mere contemptible trifling, as if a
man should lose himself in some game, or in the rapture of
sweet music, with a great conflagration raging before his eyes.
In the universal moral shipwreck, how can one toy with these
old world trifles, while the perishing are stretching out their
hands for help?<a id="noteref_1620" name="noteref_1620" href="#note_1620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1620</span></span></a> Not that Seneca despises the inheritance of
ancient wisdom, so far as it has any gospel for humanity.<a id="noteref_1621" name="noteref_1621" href="#note_1621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1621</span></span></a> He
will accept good moral teaching from any quarter, from Plato

is ready to give almost divine honours to the great teachers
of the human race. But he also feels that no moral teaching
can be final. After a thousand ages, there will still be room
for making some addition to the message of the past. There
will always be a need for fresh adjustments and applications
of the remedies which past wisdom has handed down.<a id="noteref_1623" name="noteref_1623" href="#note_1623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1623</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is almost needless to say that Seneca has almost a contempt
for the so-called liberal studies of his day.<a id="noteref_1624" name="noteref_1624" href="#note_1624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1624</span></span></a> There is only
one truly liberal study, that which aims at liberating the will
from the bondage of desire. Granted that it is necessary as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mental discipline to submit to the grammarian in youth; yet
experience shows that this training does nothing to form the
virtuous character.<a id="noteref_1625" name="noteref_1625" href="#note_1625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1625</span></span></a> Who can respect a man who wastes his
mature years, like Didymus, in inquiries as to the relative
ages of Hecuba or Helen, or the name of the mother of <a name="corr300" id="corr300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Aeneas</span>,
or the character of Anacreon or Sappho?<a id="noteref_1626" name="noteref_1626" href="#note_1626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1626</span></span></a> The man of serious
purpose will rather try to forget these trifles than continue
the study of them. And Seneca treats in the same fashion the
hair-splitting and verbal subtleties of some of the older Stoics.
He acquiesces indeed, in their threefold division of Philosophy
into Logic, Physics, and Ethics; but for the first department
he seems to have but scant respect, though once or twice he
amuses his pupil Lucilius by a disquisition on Genus and
Species, or the Platonic and Aristotelian <span class="tei tei-q">“Causes,”</span> in the
style of the Stoic scholasticism.<a id="noteref_1627" name="noteref_1627" href="#note_1627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1627</span></span></a> Seneca was writing for
posterity; he has his intellectual vanity; and he probably
wished to show that, while he set but little store by such
studies, this was not due to an imperfect knowledge of them.
It is because life is too short, and its great problems are too
urgent, to permit a serious man to spend his precious years in
fruitless intellectual play. He calls on Lucilius to leave such
barren subtleties, which bring the greatest of all themes down
to the level of intellectual jugglery.<a id="noteref_1628" name="noteref_1628" href="#note_1628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1628</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the department of Physics Seneca has much more
respect, and he evidently devoted much attention to it. We
have traces of some lost works of his on scientific subjects, and
there is still extant a treatise in seven books on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural
Questions</span></span>, which became a handbook of science in the Middle
Ages.<a id="noteref_1629" name="noteref_1629" href="#note_1629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1629</span></span></a> It deals with such subjects as we meet with in the
poem of Lucretius, thunder and lightning, winds and earthquakes,
and rising and failing springs. But it has perhaps
less of the scientific spirit than Lucretius, according to our
modern standards. We have abundant reference to old
physical authorities, to Thales, Anaximenes, Anaximander,
Diogenes of Apollonia, to Caecina and Attalus. But
the conception of any scientific method beyond more or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>less ingenious hypothesis, or of any scientific verification of
hypothesis, is utterly absent. This is of course a general
characteristic of most of the scientific effort of antiquity. The
truth is that, although Seneca probably had some interest in
natural phenomena, he had a far more profound interest in
human nature and human destiny. The older Stoics, with some
variations, subordinated Physics to Ethics, as of inferior and
only subsidiary importance.<a id="noteref_1630" name="noteref_1630" href="#note_1630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1630</span></span></a> Seneca carries this subordination
almost to extremes, although he also is sometimes inconsistent.<a id="noteref_1631" name="noteref_1631" href="#note_1631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1631</span></span></a>
He thinks it significant that while the World-Spirit has hidden
gold, the great tempter and corruptor, far beneath our feet, it
has displayed, in mysterious yet pompous splendour, in the
azure canopy above us, the heavenly orbs which are popularly
believed to control our destiny in the material sense, and which
may really govern it, by raising our minds to the contemplation
of an infinite mystery and a marvellous order.<a id="noteref_1632" name="noteref_1632" href="#note_1632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1632</span></span></a> To Seneca, as
to Kant, there seems a mystic tie between the starry heavens
above and the moral law within. In the prologue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural
Questions</span></span>, indeed, carried away for the moment by the grandeur
of his theme, Seneca seems to exalt the contemplation of the
infinite distances and mysterious depths and majestic order of
the stellar world far above the moral struggles of our mundane
life. The earth shrinks to a mere point in infinitude, an
ant-hill where the human insects mark out their Lilliputian
territories and make their wars and voyages for their lifetime
of an hour.<a id="noteref_1633" name="noteref_1633" href="#note_1633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1633</span></span></a> This, however, is rather a piece of rhetoric than a
careful statement of Seneca’s real view. In the Letters, again
and again, we are told that virtue is the one important thing,
that the conquest of passion raises man to be equal to God,<a id="noteref_1634" name="noteref_1634" href="#note_1634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1634</span></span></a>
and that in the release of the rational or divine part of us
from bondage to the flesh, man recovers a lost liberty, a
primeval dignity. But in this struggle the spirit may refresh
and elevate itself by looking up to the divine world
from which it draws its origin, and to which it may, perchance,
return. To Seneca’s mind the so-called physics really involve
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>theology and metaphysics. In the contemplation of the vastness
of the material universe, the mind may be aroused to
the urgency and interest of the great questions touching God,
His relation to fate, to the world, and man.<a id="noteref_1635" name="noteref_1635" href="#note_1635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1635</span></span></a> The scientific interest
in Seneca is evidently not the strongest. There are still
indeed the echoes of the old philosophies which sought man’s
true greatness and final beatitude in the clear vision of abstract
truth. But Seneca is travelling rapidly on the way which
leads to another vision of the celestial city, in which emotion,
the passionate yearning for holiness as well as truth, blends
with and tends to overpower the ideal of a passionless eternity
of intellectual intuition. In Seneca’s rapturous outburst on
the gate of deliverance opened by death, making allowance for
difference of associations and beliefs, there is surely a strange
note of kindred sympathy, across the gulf of thirteen centuries,
with Thomas à Kempis.<a id="noteref_1636" name="noteref_1636" href="#note_1636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1636</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural Questions</span></span> were, as he tells us, the work of his
old age.<a id="noteref_1637" name="noteref_1637" href="#note_1637"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1637</span></span></a> He has a lofty conception of his task, of the importance
of the subject to the right culture of the spirit, and
he summons up all his remaining energy to do it justice.
But the work falls far short, in interest and executive skill,
of a treatise like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Beneficiis</span></span>, and the principle of
edification—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnibus sermonibus aliquid salutare miscendum</span></span><a id="noteref_1638" name="noteref_1638" href="#note_1638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1638</span></span></a>—is
too obtrusive, and sometimes leads to incongruous and
almost ludicrous effects. A reference to the mullet launches
him on a discourse on luxury.<a id="noteref_1639" name="noteref_1639" href="#note_1639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1639</span></span></a> A discourse on mirrors would
hardly seem to lend itself to moralising. Yet the invention
furnishes to Seneca impressive lessons on self-knowledge, and
a chance of glorifying the simple age when the unkempt
daughter of a Scipio, who received her scanty dowry in
uncoined metal, had never had her vanity aroused by the
reflected image of her charms.<a id="noteref_1640" name="noteref_1640" href="#note_1640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1640</span></span></a> The subject of lightning

A prologue, on the conflict to be waged with passion and
luxury and chance and change, winds up abruptly with the
invitation—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quaeramus ergo de aquis</span></span> ... <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua ratione fiant</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1642" name="noteref_1642" href="#note_1642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1642</span></span></a> The
investigation closes with an imaginative description of the
great cataclysm which is destined to overwhelm in ruin the
present order. The earthquakes in Campania in <span class="tei tei-sic">66</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>

the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural Questions</span></span> is perhaps the best, and the most worthy
of Seneca. In all these inquiries, he says, into the secrets of
nature, we should proceed with reverent caution and self-distrust,
as men veil their faces and bend in humbleness before
a sacrifice.<a id="noteref_1644" name="noteref_1644" href="#note_1644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1644</span></span></a> How many an orb, moving in the depths of space,

the great mysteries. There are many things destined to be
revealed to far-distant ages, when our memory shall have
passed away,<a id="noteref_1646" name="noteref_1646" href="#note_1646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1646</span></span></a> of which our time does not deserve the revelation.
Our energies are spent in discovering fresh ingenuities of

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca, in the epilogue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural Questions</span></span>, remarks
sarcastically that, as all human progress is slow, so, even with
all our efforts of self-indulgence, we have not yet reached the
finished perfection of depravity; we are still making discoveries
in vice. In another passage he maintains that his own age is no
worse than others.<a id="noteref_1648" name="noteref_1648" href="#note_1648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1648</span></span></a> But this is only because at all times the mass
of men are bad. Such pessimism in the first and second centuries
was a prevalent tone. We meet it alike in Persius, Petronius,
Martial, and Juvenal, and in Seneca, Tacitus, Pliny, Epictetus,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Marcus Aurelius.<a id="noteref_1649" name="noteref_1649" href="#note_1649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1649</span></span></a> The rage for wealth and luxury, the
frenzy of vice which perverted natural healthy instincts and
violated the last retreats of modesty, the combination of
ostentation and meanness in social life, the cowardice and the
cruelty which are twin offspring of pampered self-indulgence,
the vanity of culture and the vanishing of ideals, the vague
restless ennui, hovering between satiety and passion, between
faint glimpses of goodness and ignominious failure, between fits
of ambition and self-abandoned languor, all these and more had
come under the eye of Seneca as an observer or a director of
souls.<a id="noteref_1650" name="noteref_1650" href="#note_1650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1650</span></span></a> It is a lost world that he has before him, trying fruitless
anodynes for its misery, holding out its hands for help from
any quarter.<a id="noteref_1651" name="noteref_1651" href="#note_1651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1651</span></span></a> The consuming earnestness of Seneca, about which,
in spite of his rhetoric, there can be no mistake, and his endless
iteration are the measure of his feeling as to the gravity of the
case. Seneca is the earliest and most powerful apostle of a
great moral revival. His studied phrase, his epigrammatic
point seem often out of place; his occasionally tinsel rhetoric
sometimes offends a modern taste. We often miss the austere
and simple seriousness of Epictetus, the cultivated serenity and
the calm clear-sighted resignation of Marcus Aurelius. Still let
us admit that here is a man, with all his moral faults which he
freely confesses, with all his rhetoric which was a part of
his very nature, who felt he had a mission, and meant to fulfil
it with all the resources of his mind. He is one of the
few heathen moralists who warm moral teaching with the
emotion of modern religion, and touch it with the sadness
and the yearning which spring from a consciousness of man’s
infinite capacities and his actual degradation; one in whose
eyes can be seen the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">amor ulterioris ripae</span></span>, in whose teaching
there are searching precepts which go to the roots of conduct,
and are true for all ages of our race. He adheres formally to
the lines of the old Stoic system in his moments of calm
logical consistency. But when the enthusiasm of humanity, the
passion to win souls to goodness and moral truth is upon him,
all the old philosophical differences fade, the new wine bursts
the old bottles; the Platonic dualism, the eternal conflict of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>flesh and spirit,<a id="noteref_1652" name="noteref_1652" href="#note_1652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1652</span></span></a> the Platonic vision of God, nay, a higher
vision of the Creator, the pitiful and loving Guardian, the Giver
of all good, the Power which draws us to Himself, who receives
us at death, and in whom is our eternal beatitude, these
ideas, so alien to the older Stoicism, transfigure its hardness,
and its cold, repellent moral idealism becomes a religion.<a id="noteref_1653" name="noteref_1653" href="#note_1653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1653</span></span></a>
Seneca’s system is really a religion; it is morality inspired by
belief in a spiritual world and <span class="tei tei-q">“touched by emotion.”</span> In a
remarkable letter, he discusses the question whether, for the
conduct of life, precept is sufficient without dogma, whether
a man can govern his life by empirical rules, without a
foundation of general principles. Can a religion dispense with
dogma?<a id="noteref_1654" name="noteref_1654" href="#note_1654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1654</span></span></a> Seneca, as a casuist and spiritual director, was not
likely to undervalue the importance of definite precept, adapted
to the circumstances of the case. The philosopher, who was
a regular official in great families, probably dealt chiefly in
precept, on a basis of authority concealed and rarely scrutinised.
But Seneca is not an ordinary professional director. He has
a serious purpose; he feels that he is dealing with the
most momentous of all problems—how to form or reform a life,
with a view to its true end, how the final good of man is to
be realised only in virtuous action. But action will not be right
and virtuous unless the will be also right, and rightness of will
depends on ordered habit of the soul,<a id="noteref_1655" name="noteref_1655" href="#note_1655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1655</span></span></a> and that again springs
from right general principles or dogmas. In other words, a true
theory of conduct is necessary to virtue in the highest sense.
Mere imperative precept and rule cannot give steadiness and
continuity to conduct. The motive, the clear perception of the
guiding principle, can alone dignify an act with a peculiar moral
distinction. In order to possess that character, the external
act must be rooted in a faith in the rational law of conduct.
Particular precepts may produce an external obedience to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that law, but they cannot give the uniformity and certainty of
the inner light and the regulated will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca is not a sectarian dogmatist, although he lays so
much stress on the necessity of dogma to virtuous conduct. He
boldly declares that he does not follow absolutely any of
the Stoic doctors. He defends Epicurus against the vulgar
misunderstanding of his theory of pleasure, and the more
vulgar practical deductions from it. He often quotes his
maxims with admiration to Lucilius.<a id="noteref_1656" name="noteref_1656" href="#note_1656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1656</span></span></a> In his views of the
nature of God and His relation to the external world and to
the human soul, Seneca often seems to follow the old Stoic
tradition. There are other passages where he seems to waver
between different conceptions of God, the Creator of the universe,
the incorporeal Reason, the divine breath diffused through all
things, great and small, Fate, or the immutable chain of interlinked
causation.<a id="noteref_1657" name="noteref_1657" href="#note_1657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1657</span></span></a> It is also clear that, from the tone of his
mind, and the fact that the centre of philosophical interest for
him is the moral life of man, he tends towards a more ethical
conception of the Deity, as the Being who loves and cares for
man. All this may be admitted and will be further noticed
on a later page. Yet Seneca, in strict theory, probably never
became a dissenter from the physical or ontological creed of
his school. He adhered, in the last resort, to the Stoic pantheism,
which represented God and the universe, force and
formless matter, as ultimately issuing from the one substratum
of the ethereal fire of Heraclitus, and in the great cataclysm,
returning again to their source.<a id="noteref_1658" name="noteref_1658" href="#note_1658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1658</span></span></a> He also held theoretically the
Stoic materialism, and the Stoic principle, that only corporeal
natures can act on one another.<a id="noteref_1659" name="noteref_1659" href="#note_1659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1659</span></span></a> The force which moulds
indeterminate matter into concrete form is spirit, breath, in the
literal sense, interfused in rude matter, and by its tension,
outward and again inward upon itself, producing form and
quality and energy. Mere matter could never mould itself,
or develop from within a power of movement and action. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this material force which shapes the universe from within is
also rational, and the universe is a rational being, guided by
the indwelling reason to predestined ends, and obedient to
a universal law. The God of the Stoics is thus a very elastic
or comprehensive conception. He may be viewed as the
ubiquitous, impalpable force, which may, in the lack of more
accurate expression, be called air, ether, fire. He is the soul,
the breath, the Anima Mundi. He is also the universal law,
the rational principle, underlying all the apparently casual and
fitful phenomena of physical nature and human life. God
may also surely be regarded as the eternal Fate, the power in
the ruthless, yet merciful sequence of inevitable causation.<a id="noteref_1660" name="noteref_1660" href="#note_1660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1660</span></span></a>
And, in milder and more optimistic moods, we may view Him
as a watchful Providence, caring for men more than they seem
to care for themselves, saving them from the consequences of
their own errors and misdeeds. In Seneca, He develops into
a moral and spiritual Being, the source of all spiritual intuition
and virtuous emotion, the secret power within us making for
righteousness, as He is the secret force in all nature making
for order.<a id="noteref_1661" name="noteref_1661" href="#note_1661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1661</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems a little crude and superficial to contrast the
materialist and idealist conceptions of God in the later Stoic
creed. What human conception of Him is free from similar
contradictions? How can any conception of Him, expressed
in human language, avoid them? And in Seneca’s conception
of soul, even as material, there is something so thin, so subtle,
and elusive, that the bounds of matter and spirit seem to
melt away and disappear.<a id="noteref_1662" name="noteref_1662" href="#note_1662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1662</span></span></a> However loyal he may be in
form to Stoic materialism, Seneca in the end regards God as
no mere material force, however refined and etherealised, but
a spiritual power; not perhaps limited by the bounds of
personality, but instinct with moral tendencies, nay, a moral
impetus, which no mere physical force could ever develop.<a id="noteref_1663" name="noteref_1663" href="#note_1663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1663</span></span></a> The
growing dualism in Seneca’s metaphysics is the result of the
growing dualism of his psychology. In accord with the old
Stoic doctors, he sometimes formulates the material nature of
the soul, and its essential unity. It is, like the Anima Mundi,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>warm breath or subtle fire, penetrating all parts of the body,
discharging currents from the central heart to the several organs.
It is primarily rational, and all the lower powers of passion are
derived from the controlling and unifying reason. It is a spark
of the universal Spirit, holding the same place in the human
organism as the Divine Spirit does in the universe.<a id="noteref_1664" name="noteref_1664" href="#note_1664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1664</span></span></a> But
experience and reflection drove Seneca more and more into an
acceptance of the Platonic opposition of reason and passion, an
unceasing struggle of the flesh and spirit, in which the old
Stoic theory of the oneness of the rational soul tended to
disappear.<a id="noteref_1665" name="noteref_1665" href="#note_1665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1665</span></span></a> This is only one, but it is the most important,
modification of ancient theory forced on Seneca by a closer
application of theory to the facts of human life, and a completer
analysis of them. The individual consciousness, and the
spectacle of human life, alike witness to the inevitable tendency
of human nature to corruption. Even after the great cataclysm,
when a new earth shall arise from the waters of the deluge,
and a new man, in perfect innocence, shall enter on this fair
inheritance, the clouds will soon gather again, and darken
the fair deceitful dawn.<a id="noteref_1666" name="noteref_1666" href="#note_1666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1666</span></span></a> The weary struggle of flesh and
spirit will begin once more, in which the flesh is so often the
victor. For to Seneca, as to the Orphic mystics and to Plato,
the body is a prison, and life one long punishment.<a id="noteref_1667" name="noteref_1667" href="#note_1667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1667</span></span></a> Such
is the misery of this mortal life, such the danger of hopeless
corruption, that no one would accept the gift of existence if
he could foresee the evil in store for him.<a id="noteref_1668" name="noteref_1668" href="#note_1668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1668</span></span></a> And death, the
object of dread to the blind masses, is really the one compensation
for the calamity of birth, either as a happy return to
antenatal tranquillity, or as the gateway to a glorious freedom
and vision of the Divine.<a id="noteref_1669" name="noteref_1669" href="#note_1669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1669</span></span></a> Seneca, indeed, does not always
express himself in this strain. He is often the consistent,
orthodox Stoic, who glories in the rounded perfection of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sapiens</span></span>, triumphing, even in this life, over all the seductions
of sense and the fallacies of perverted reason, and, in virtue
of the divine strength within him, making himself, even here
below, equal with God in moral purity and freedom.<a id="noteref_1670" name="noteref_1670" href="#note_1670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1670</span></span></a> In such
moods, he will adhere to the Stoic psychology: reason will be
all in all; virtue will be uniform, complete, attained by one
supreme victorious effort. But the vision is constantly crossed
and darkened by doubts which are raised by the terrible facts
of life. The moral problem becomes more difficult and complicated;
the vision of perfection recedes to an infinite distance,
and the glorious deliverance is reserved for an immortal life
of which the older Stoics did not often dream.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still, we can find in Seneca all the Stoic gospel, and
moral idealism. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nil bonum nisi verum”</span> is the fundamental
principle. The failures, aberrations, and sins of men arise
from a false conception of what is good, produced by the
warping effect of external things upon the higher principle.
The avaricious, the ambitious, the sensual, live in a vain show.
They are pursuing unreal objects of desire, which cheat and
befool the reason, and turn to ashes when they are won.
The <span class="tei tei-q">“kingdom of Heaven is within.”</span> It is the freedom, the
peace, the tranquil sense of power over all that is fortuitous
and external and fleeting, which alone can realise the highest
good of man.<a id="noteref_1671" name="noteref_1671" href="#note_1671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1671</span></span></a> It is attained only by virtue, that is, by living
in obedience to the law of reason, which has its voice and
representative in each human soul. The summons to yield
ourselves to the law of nature and reason simply calls us to
obey our highest part (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: normal">τὸ ἡγεμονικόν</span></span>), which is a steadfast
witness to the eternal truth of things, and, if unbribed and
unperverted, will discern infallibly the right line of conduct
amid all the clamorous or seductive temptations of the flesh or
of the world. Nothing is a real good which has not the
stamp and hall-mark of reason, which is not within the soul
itself, that is within our own power. Everything worth
having or wishing for is within. External things, wealth,
power, high place, the pleasures of sense, are transitory, deceptive,
unstable, the gifts of Fortune, and equally at her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mercy. In the mad struggle for these ephemeral pleasures,
the wise man retires unobserved from the scene of cruel and
sordid rapacity, having secretly within him the greatest prize
of all, which Fortune cannot give or take away.<a id="noteref_1672" name="noteref_1672" href="#note_1672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1672</span></span></a> If these
things were really good, then God would be less happy than
the slave of lust and ambition, than the sensualist who is fascinated
by a mistress or a minion, the trader who may be ruined
by a storm, the wealthy minister who may at any moment be
ordered to death by a Nero.<a id="noteref_1673" name="noteref_1673" href="#note_1673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1673</span></span></a> The only real liberty and
human dignity are to be found in renunciation. If we
jealously guard and reverence the divine reason within us,
and obey its monitions, which are in truth the voice of God,
the Universal Reason, then we have an impregnable fortress
which cannot be stormed by any adverse fortune. The peace
and freedom so won may be called, although Seneca does not
so call it, the <span class="tei tei-q">“peace of God.”</span> For it is in fact the restored
harmony between the human spirit and the Reason of the
world, and the cessation of the weary conflict between the
<span class="tei tei-q">“law in the members”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the law of the mind,”</span> which
ends so often in that other peace of a <span class="tei tei-q">“mare mortuum,”</span> a
stillness of moral death.<a id="noteref_1674" name="noteref_1674" href="#note_1674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1674</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gospel of Seneca, with all its searching power, seems
wanting in some of the essentials of an effective religion which
can work on character. Where, it may be asked, is the force
to come from which shall nerve the repentant one to essay
the steep ascent to the calm of indefectible virtue? And
what is the reward which can more than compensate for the
great renunciation? With regard to the first question, the
Stoic answer is clear. The reforming force is the divine
reason, indwelling in every human soul,<a id="noteref_1675" name="noteref_1675" href="#note_1675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1675</span></span></a> which, if it is able,
or is permitted, to emancipate itself from bondage to the things
of sense, will inevitably gravitate to the divine world, from
which it sprang. The question of necessity and freedom of the
will has not much interest for Seneca, as a practical moralist.
He believes theoretically in the old Stoic dogmas on the subject.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>From one point of view, God may be regarded as the eternal
Fate, the inevitable law of causation. And as the Universal
Reason, He cannot act otherwise than He does, without violating
His very nature. But His action is self-determined and therefore
free and spontaneous.<a id="noteref_1676" name="noteref_1676" href="#note_1676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1676</span></span></a> This freedom man only attains by
breaking away from the cruel servitude to passion and external
circumstance. As a practical moral teacher, Seneca is bound
to say that we can take the higher road if we will. The first
step towards freedom is to grasp firmly the fundamental law
of the moral life—that the only good lies in conformity to
reason, to the higher part of our being. If we yield to its
bidding, we can at once cut ourselves off from the deceitful life
of the senses, and the vision of the true beatitude in virtue at
once opens on the inner eye. When that vision has been seen,
we must then seek to form a habit of the soul which shall
steadily conform to the universal law, and finally give birth
to a settled purpose, issuing inevitably in virtuous act.<a id="noteref_1677" name="noteref_1677" href="#note_1677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1677</span></span></a> It
is this fixed and stable resolution which is the Stoic ideal,
although experience showed that it was rarely attained. The
great renunciation is thus the entrance on a state of true freedom,
which is realised only by submitting ourselves to the
law of reason, that is of God. By obedience to rational law
man is raised to a level far transcending the transient and
shadowy dignities of the world. His rational and divine part
is reunited to the Divine Spirit which <span class="tei tei-q">“makes for righteousness”</span>;
he places himself in the sweep and freedom of a movement
which finds its image and counterpart in the majestic
and ordered movements of the heavenly spheres. If we ask,
how can poor humanity, so abject, so brutalised, so deadened
by the downward pressure of the flesh and the world, ever
release itself and rise to those empyrean heights, the answer is,
through the original strength of the rational, which is the
divine element in the human soul. It may be, and actually
is, in the mass of men, drugged and silenced by the seductions
of sense and the deceptions of the world. But if, in some
moment of detachment and elation, when its captors and
jailors relax their guard, it can escape their clutches, it will at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>once seek the region of its birth, and its true home. It is in
the kindred of the human reason with the Divine, the Reason
of the world, that we must seek the reconciliation of two
apparently opposite points of view. At one time the Stoic
doctor tells us that we must trust to our own strength in the
moral struggle. And again Seneca, in almost Christian phrase,
comforts his disciple with the vision of God holding out a
succouring hand to struggling virtue, just as he warns the
backslider of an eye <span class="tei tei-q">“that seeth in secret.”</span> Woe to him
who despises that Witness.<a id="noteref_1678" name="noteref_1678" href="#note_1678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1678</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With such a conception of the relation of the human reason to
the Divine, Seneca was bound to believe that human nature, as
it is, had fallen away from original and spontaneous innocence.
In the equal enjoyment of the unforced gifts of nature, in the
absence of the avarice and luxury which the development of
the arts, the exploitation of the earth’s hidden wealth, and the
competitive struggle, born of a social life growing more and
more complicated, have generated, the primeval man was unsolicited
by the passions which have made life a hell.<a id="noteref_1679" name="noteref_1679" href="#note_1679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1679</span></span></a> Yet
this blissful state was one of innocence rather than of virtue;
it was the result of ignorance of evil rather than determined
choice of good.<a id="noteref_1680" name="noteref_1680" href="#note_1680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1680</span></span></a> And the man who, in the midst of a corrupt
society, fights his way to virtue, will take far higher moral rank
than our simple ancestors, who wandered in the unravaged
garden of the Golden Age. For the man born in a time when
the nobler instincts have been deadened by the lust of gold
and power and sensual excess, the virtuous will can only be
won by a hard struggle.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Confronted with the facts of life, and fired with a passion to
win men to a higher law, the later Stoicism had in some points
to soften the rigid lines of earlier theory. The severe idealism
of the great doctors was a mere dream of an impossible detachment,
the inexorable demand of a pitiless logic. Virtue, being
conformity to the immutable law of reason, was conceived as a
rounded, flawless whole, to which nothing could be added, and
to which nothing must be wanting. It presupposes, or is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>identical with, a settled intellectual clearness, an unclouded
knowledge of the truly good, which must inevitably issue in
perfect act. It is a single, uniform mental state from which all
the separate virtues spring as from a single root.<a id="noteref_1681" name="noteref_1681" href="#note_1681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1681</span></span></a> The moral
value of an act depends entirely on will, intention, that is, on
the intellectual perception. And as there are no gradations in
the mental state, so there are no gradations in moral conduct
which issues from it. There are no distinctions between
things morally good, between <span class="tei tei-q">“divine”</span> things; and so, just as
in the older Calvinistic system, there is no class intermediate
between the wise and the foolish, the saved and the lost.
And conversion, <span class="tei tei-q">“transfiguration,”</span> the change from folly to
wisdom, is regarded as instantaneous and complete.<a id="noteref_1682" name="noteref_1682" href="#note_1682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1682</span></span></a> Even
those who are struggling upward, but have not yet reached
the top, are still to be reckoned among the foolish, just as the
man a few inches below the waves will be drowned as certainly
as if he were sunk fathoms deep. And, as there is no mean state
in morals, so the extremes are necessarily finished and perfect
types of virtue and reprobacy. The ideal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sapiens</span></span>, who combines
in himself all the moral and intellectual attributes that
go to make up the ideal of serene, flawless virtue, has been the
mark for ridicule from the days of Horace.<a id="noteref_1683" name="noteref_1683" href="#note_1683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1683</span></span></a> Such an ideal,
soaring into the pure cold regions of virgin snow, left the great
mass of men grovelling in filth and darkness. And it was in
this light that the severe Stoic regarded the condition of the
multitude. They are all equally bad, and they will always be
bad, from age to age. Every generation mourns over its degeneracy,
but it is no worse than its ancestors, and its posterity
will be no better. The only variation is in the various fashion of
the vices.<a id="noteref_1684" name="noteref_1684" href="#note_1684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1684</span></span></a> In any crowded scene, says Seneca, in the forum or
the circus, you have a mere gathering of savage beasts, a spectacle
of vice incarnate.<a id="noteref_1685" name="noteref_1685" href="#note_1685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1685</span></span></a> In the garb of peace, they are engaged in
a truceless war, hating the fortunate, trampling on the fallen.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Viewing this scene of shameless lust and cupidity where every
tie of duty or friendship is violated, if the wise man were to
measure his indignation by the atrocity of the offenders, his
anger must end in madness. But we are all bad men living
among the bad, and we should be gentle to one another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The idealism and the pessimism of the earlier Stoics were
alike fatal to any effort of moral reform. The cold, flawless
perfection of the man of triumphant reason was an impossible
model which could only discourage and repel aspirants to the
higher life. The ghastly moral wreck of ordinary human nature,
in which not a single germ of virtuous impulse seemed to have
survived the ruin, left apparently no hope of rescue or escape.
If morals were to be anything but an abstract theory, if they
were to have any bearing on the actual character and destiny
of man, their demand must be modified. And so in many
essential points it was, even before Seneca.<a id="noteref_1686" name="noteref_1686" href="#note_1686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1686</span></span></a> The ideal contempt
for all external things had to give way to an Aristotelian
recognition of the value of some of them for a virtuous life.
And Seneca is sometimes a follower of Aristotle, as in the
admission, so convenient to the millionaire, that wealth may be
used by the wise man for higher moral ends.<a id="noteref_1687" name="noteref_1687" href="#note_1687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1687</span></span></a> He will not be
the slave of money; he will be its master. He will admit it
to his home, but not to his heart, as a thing which may take to
itself wings at any moment, but which may meanwhile be used
to cheer and warm him in his struggles, and may be dispensed
in beneficent help to dependents. In the same way, beside the
ideal of perfect conformity to the law of reason, there appeared
a class of conditional duties. To conform absolutely to the law
of reason, to realise the highest good through virtue, remains
the highest Stoic ideal. But if, beside the highest good,
it is permitted to attach a certain value to some among
the external objects of desire, manifestly a whole class of
varying duties arises in the field of choice and avoidance.<a id="noteref_1688" name="noteref_1688" href="#note_1688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1688</span></span></a>
And again the ideal of imperturbable calm, which approached
the apathy of the Cynics, was softened by the admission of
rational dispositions of feeling.<a id="noteref_1689" name="noteref_1689" href="#note_1689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1689</span></span></a> These concessions to
    im<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>perious facts of human life, of course, modified the awful
moral antithesis of wise and foolish, good and reprobate.
Where is the perfectly wise man, with his single moral
purpose, his unruffled serenity, his full assurance of his own
impregnable strength, actually to be found?<a id="noteref_1690" name="noteref_1690" href="#note_1690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1690</span></span></a> He is not to
be discovered among the most devoted adherents of the true
philosophic creed. Even a Socrates falls short of the sublime
standard. If we seek for the wise man in the fabulous past,
we shall find only heroic force, or a blissful, untempted ignorance,
which are alike wanting in the first essential of virtue.<a id="noteref_1691" name="noteref_1691" href="#note_1691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1691</span></span></a> As
the perfect ideal of moral wisdom, imperturbable, assured,
and indefectible, receded to remote ideal distances, so the
condemnation of all moral states below an impossible perfection
to indiscriminate reprobacy<a id="noteref_1692" name="noteref_1692" href="#note_1692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1692</span></span></a> had to be revoked.
Seneca maintains that men are all bad, but he is forced to
admit that they are not all equally bad, nay, that there are
men who, although not quite emancipated from the snares of
the world and the flesh, have reached various stages on the
upward way. He even distinguishes three classes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">proficientes</span></span>,
of persons on the path of moral progress.<a id="noteref_1693" name="noteref_1693" href="#note_1693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1693</span></span></a> There is
the man who has conquered many serious vices, but is still
captive to others. Again, there is the man who has got rid
of the worst faults and passions, but who is not secure against
a relapse. There is a third class who have almost reached
the goal. They have achieved the great moral victory; they
have embraced the one true object of desire; they are safe
from any chance of falling away; but they want the final
gift of full assurance reserved for the truly wise.<a id="noteref_1694" name="noteref_1694" href="#note_1694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1694</span></span></a> They have
not attained to the crowning glory of conscious strength. Seneca
is still in bondage to the hard Stoic tradition, in spite of his
aberrations from it. The great Catholic virtue of humility is
to him still, theoretically at least, a disqualification for the
highest spiritual rank.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet Seneca is far from wanting in humility. In giving
counsels of perfection, he candidly confesses that he is himself
far from the ideal.<a id="noteref_1695" name="noteref_1695" href="#note_1695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1695</span></span></a> Indeed, his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Letters</span></span> reveal a character
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which, with lofty ideals, and energetic aspiration, is very far
removed from the serene joy and peace of the true Stoic sage.
He has not got the invulnerable panoply from which all the
shafts of fortune glance aside. He shows again and again how
deep a shadow the terror of his capricious master could cast
over his life, how he can be disturbed even by the smaller
troubles of existence, by the slights of great society, by the
miseries of a sea voyage, or the noises of a bath.<a id="noteref_1696" name="noteref_1696" href="#note_1696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1696</span></span></a> In the
counsels addressed to Lucilius, Seneca is probably quite as
often preaching to himself. The ennui, the unsteadiness of
moral purpose, the clinging to wealth and power, the haunting
fears or timid anticipations of coming evil, for which he is
constantly suggesting spiritual remedies, are diagnosed with
such searching skill and vividness that we can hardly doubt
that the physician has first practised his art upon himself.<a id="noteref_1697" name="noteref_1697" href="#note_1697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1697</span></span></a>
Nor has he entire faith in his own insight or in the potency
of the remedies which ancient wisdom has accumulated. The
great difficulty is, that the moral patient, in proportion to the
inveteracy of his disease, is unconscious of it.<a id="noteref_1698" name="noteref_1698" href="#note_1698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1698</span></span></a> Society, with
its manifold temptations of wealth and luxury and irresponsible
ease, can so overwhelm the congenital tendency to virtue,<a id="noteref_1699" name="noteref_1699" href="#note_1699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1699</span></span></a>

they are inevitably getting worse. There is such a state, in
the end, as hopeless, irreclaimable reprobacy. Yet even for
the hoary sinner Seneca will not altogether despair, so long
as there lingers in him some divine discontent, however faint,
some lingering regret for a lost purity. He will not lose
hope of converting even a mocker like Marcellinus, who
amuses himself with jeers at the vices and inconsistencies of
professing philosophers, and does not spare himself. Seneca

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca’s gospel, as he preaches it, is for a limited class.
With all his professed belief in the equality and brotherhood
of men, Seneca addresses himself, through the aristocratic
Epicurean Lucilius, to the slaves of wealth and the vices
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which it breeds. The men whom he wishes to save are
masters of great households, living in stately palaces, and
striving to escape from the weariness of satiety by visits to
Baiae or Praeneste.<a id="noteref_1702" name="noteref_1702" href="#note_1702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1702</span></span></a> They are men who have awful secrets,
and whose apparent tranquillity is constantly disturbed by
vague terrors,<a id="noteref_1703" name="noteref_1703" href="#note_1703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1703</span></span></a> whose intellects are wasted on the vanities
of a conventional culture or the logomachies of a barren
dialectic.<a id="noteref_1704" name="noteref_1704" href="#note_1704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1704</span></span></a> They are people whose lives are a record of weak
purpose and conflicting aims, and who are surprised by old
age while they are still barely on the threshold of real moral
life.<a id="noteref_1705" name="noteref_1705" href="#note_1705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1705</span></span></a> With no religious or philosophic faith, death is to such
men the great terror, as closing for ever that life of the
flesh which has been at once so pleasant and so tormenting.<a id="noteref_1706" name="noteref_1706" href="#note_1706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1706</span></span></a>
In dealing with such people, Seneca recognises the need both
of the great principles of right living and of particular precepts,
adapted to varieties of character and circumstance. The
true and solid foundation of conduct must always be the clear
perception of moral truth, giving birth to rightly-directed purpose
and supplying the right motive. For example, without a
true conception of God as a spirit, worship will be gross and
anthropomorphic.<a id="noteref_1707" name="noteref_1707" href="#note_1707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1707</span></span></a> The doctrine of the brotherhood of all men
in the universal commonwealth is the only solid ground of the
social charities and of humanity to slaves. Yet dogma is not
enough; discipline must be added. The moral director has to
deal with very imperfect moral states, some of quite rudimentary
growth, and his disciples may have to be treated as boys
learning to write, whose fingers the master must guide
mechanically across the tablet.<a id="noteref_1708" name="noteref_1708" href="#note_1708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1708</span></span></a> The latent goodness of
humanity must be disencumbered of the load which, through
untold ages, corrupt society has heaped upon it. The delusions
of the world and the senses must be exposed, the judgment,
confused and dazzled by their glamour, must be cleared and
steadied, the weak must be encouraged, the slothful and backsliding
must be aroused to continuous effort in habitual converse
with some good man who has trodden the same paths
before.<a id="noteref_1709" name="noteref_1709" href="#note_1709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1709</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Thus the great <span class="tei tei-q">“Ars Vitae,”</span> founded on a few simple
principles of reason, developed into a most complicated system
of casuistry and spiritual direction. How far it was successful
we cannot pretend to say. But the thoughtful reader of
Seneca’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Letters</span></span> cannot help coming to the conclusion that,
even in the reign of Nero, there must have been many of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">proficientes</span></span>, of candidates for the full Stoic faith. If Seneca
reveals the depths of depravity in his age, we are equally
bound to believe that he represents, and is trying to stimulate,
a great moral movement, a deep seated discontent with the hard,
gross materialism, thinly veiled under dilettantism and spurious
artistic sensibility, of which Nero was the type. Everything
that we have of Seneca’s, except the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tragedies</span></span>, deals with the
problems or troubles of this moral life, and the demand for
advice or consolation appears to have been urgent. Lucilius,
the young Epicurean procurator, who has been immortalised
by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Letters</span></span>, is only one of a large class of spiritual inquirers.
He not only lays his own moral difficulties before
the master, but he brings other spiritual patients for advice.<a id="noteref_1710" name="noteref_1710" href="#note_1710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1710</span></span></a>
There were evidently many trying to withdraw from the
tyranny or temptations of high life, with a more or less stable
resolution to devote themselves to reflection and amendment.
It is a curious pagan counterpart to the Christian ascetic
movement of the fourth and fifth centuries.<a id="noteref_1711" name="noteref_1711" href="#note_1711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1711</span></span></a> And, just as in
the days of S. Jerome and S. Paulinus, the deserter from the
ranks of fashion and pleasure in Nero’s time had to encounter
a storm of ridicule and misrepresentation. Philosophic retreat
was derided as mere languid self-indulgence, an unmanly
shrinking from social duty, nay, even a mere mask for the
secret vices which were, too often with truth, charged against
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soi-disant</span></span> philosopher.<a id="noteref_1712" name="noteref_1712" href="#note_1712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1712</span></span></a> Sometimes the wish to lead a
higher life was openly assailed by a cynical Epicureanism.
Virtue and philosophy were mere idle babble. The only
happiness is to make the most of the senses while the senses
still keep their fresh lust for pleasure. The days are fleeting
away never to return in which we can drink with keen zest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the joys of the flesh. What folly to spare a patrimony for a
thankless heir!<a id="noteref_1713" name="noteref_1713" href="#note_1713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1713</span></span></a> Seneca had to deal with many souls wavering
between the two ideals. One of his treatises is addressed
to a kinsman, Annaeus Serenus, who had made a full confession
of a vague unrest, an impotence of will, the conflict of moral
torpor with high resolve.<a id="noteref_1714" name="noteref_1714" href="#note_1714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1714</span></span></a> In his better moments, Annaeus
inclines to simplicity of life and self-restraint. Yet a visit to
a great house dazzles him and disturbs his balance, with the
sight of its troops of elegant slaves, its costly furniture and
luxurious feasting. He is at one time drawn to philosophic
quietude; at another he becomes the strenuous ambitious
Roman of the old days, eager for the conflicts of the forum.
He is always wavering between a conviction of the vanity of
literary trifling and the passion for literary fame.<a id="noteref_1715" name="noteref_1715" href="#note_1715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1715</span></span></a> Cannot
Seneca, to whom he owes his ideal, furnish some remedy for
this constant tendency to relapse and indecision?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is in the sympathetic handling of such cases, not in
broad philosophic theory, that the peculiar strength of Seneca
lies. His counsels were adapted to the particular difficulties
presented to him. But many of them have a universal validity.
He encourages the wish to retire into meditative quietude, but
only as a means to moral cure.<a id="noteref_1716" name="noteref_1716" href="#note_1716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1716</span></span></a> Retreat should not be an

to be a mere cloak for timid or lazy shrinking from the
burdens of life. You should withdraw from the strife and
temptations of the mundane city, only to devote yourself to
the business of the spiritual city, to cultivate self-knowledge
and self-government, to inspire the soul with the contemplation
of the Eternal and the Divine. Solitude may be a
danger, unless a man lives in the presence of <span class="tei tei-q">“One who seeth
in secret,”</span><a id="noteref_1718" name="noteref_1718" href="#note_1718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1718</span></span></a> from whom no evil thought is hidden, to whom
no prayer for evil things must be addressed.<a id="noteref_1719" name="noteref_1719" href="#note_1719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1719</span></span></a> And, lest the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>urgency, Seneca recommends his disciples to call up the
image of some good man or ancient sage, and live as if under
his eye.<a id="noteref_1720" name="noteref_1720" href="#note_1720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1720</span></span></a> The first step in moral progress is self-knowledge
and confession of one’s faults.<a id="noteref_1721" name="noteref_1721" href="#note_1721"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1721</span></span></a> Ignorance of our spiritual
disease, the doom of the indurated conscience, is the great
danger, and may be the mark of a hopeless moral state.
Hence the necessity for constant daily self-examination. In
the quiet of each night we should review our conduct and
feeling during the day, marking carefully where we have
fallen short of the higher law, and strengthening ourselves
with any signs of self-conquest. Seneca tells us that this
was his own constant practice.<a id="noteref_1722" name="noteref_1722" href="#note_1722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1722</span></span></a> For progress is only slow
and difficult. It requires watchful and unremitting effort to
reach that assured and settled purpose which issues spontaneously
in purity of thought and deed, and which raises man
to the level of the Divine freedom. There must be no pauses
of self-complacency until the work is done. There is no
mediocrity in morals. There must be no halting and unsteadiness
of purpose, no looking back to the deceitful things of
the world. Inconstancy of the wavering will only shortens the
span of this short life. How many there are who, even when
treading the last stage to death, are only beginning to live,
in the true sense, and who miss the beatitude of the man
who, having mastered the great secret, can have no addition
to his happiness from lengthened years. In the long tract of
time any life is but a moment, and of that the least part by
most men is really lived.<a id="noteref_1723" name="noteref_1723" href="#note_1723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1723</span></span></a> And this unsettled aim is liable to
constant temptation from without. We are continually within
sight and earshot of the isles of the Sirens, and only the
resolution of a Ulysses will carry us past in safety.<a id="noteref_1724" name="noteref_1724" href="#note_1724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1724</span></span></a> In fact
no isle of the Sirens can have been more dangerous than the life
of a great household in the Neronian age, when the dainties
and the vices of every land assailed the senses with multiplied
seductions, and men craved in vain for a heightened and keener
sensibility. Perpetual change of scene to the shores of Baiae,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to Apulia, to some glen in the Apennines, or to the northern
lakes, or even further, to the Rhone, the Nile, the Atlas, was
sought by the jaded man of pleasure or the man struggling in
vain to reform. But Seneca warns his disciple that wherever
he may go he will take his vices and his weakness with him.<a id="noteref_1725" name="noteref_1725" href="#note_1725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1725</span></span></a>
Let him try to work out his salvation within his great palace
on the Esquiline. Surrounded by splendour and luxury,
let him, for a time, isolate himself from them; let him lie
on a hard bed, and live on scanty fare, and fancy himself
reduced to that poverty which he dreads so much and so
foolishly.<a id="noteref_1726" name="noteref_1726" href="#note_1726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1726</span></span></a> The change will be good for body and soul; and
the temporary ascetic may return to his old life, at least
released from one of his bugbears, and refreshed with a new
sense of freedom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such were some of the precepts by which Seneca strove to
fortify the struggling virtue of his disciples. But he never
concealed from them that it is only by struggle that the remote
ideal can be attained. <span class="tei tei-q">“Vivere militare est.”</span> And almost in
the words of S. Paul, he uses the example of the gladiator or
the athlete, to arouse the energy of the aspirant after moral
perfection.<a id="noteref_1727" name="noteref_1727" href="#note_1727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1727</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“They do it for a corruptible crown.”</span><a id="noteref_1728" name="noteref_1728" href="#note_1728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1728</span></span></a> The
reward of the Stoic disciple is vain and poor to the gross
materialist. But, from the serene heights, where ideal Reason
watches the struggle, the only victor is the man who has
adopted the watchwords—self-knowledge, renunciation, resignation.
Only by following that steep path can any one ever
reach the goal of assured peace within, and be delivered from
the turmoil of chance and change. The misery of the sensual,
the worldly, and the ambitious lies in the fact that they have
staked their happiness on things which are beyond their own
power, which are the casual gifts of fortune, and may be as
capriciously withdrawn. This state is one of slavery to
external things, and the pleasure, after all, which can be drawn
from them is fleeting. Hence it is that the sensualist is
equally miserable when his pleasures are denied, and when
they are exhausted.<a id="noteref_1729" name="noteref_1729" href="#note_1729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1729</span></span></a> He places his happiness in one brief
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>moment, with the danger or the certainty either of privation
or satiety. The wise man of the Stoics, on the other hand,
has built his house upon the rock. He shuns, according to
the Pythagorean maxim, the ways of the multitude, and
trusting to the illumination of divine Reason, he takes the
narrow path.<a id="noteref_1730" name="noteref_1730" href="#note_1730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1730</span></span></a> His guiding light is the principle that the

depends only on himself, that is, on the unfettered choice of
reason. To such a man <span class="tei tei-q">“all things are his,”</span> for all worth
having is within him. His mind creates its own world, or
rather it rediscovers a lost world which was once his. He can,
if he will, annihilate the seductions of the flesh and the world,
which cease to disturb when they are contemned. He may
equally extinguish the griefs and external pains of life, for each
man is miserable just as he thinks himself.<a id="noteref_1731" name="noteref_1731" href="#note_1731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1731</span></span></a> Human nature,

by the show of material pleasure, so are they unmanned by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At certain moments, the Stoic ideal might seem to be in
danger of merging itself in the self-centred isolation of the
Cynic, asserting the defiant independence of individual virtue,
the nothingness of all external goods, the omnipotence of the
solitary will. And undoubtedly, in the last resort, Seneca
has pictured the wise man thus driven to bay, and calmly
defying the rage of the tyrant, the caprices of fortune, the
loss of health and wealth, nay the last extremity of torture
and ignominious death. His own perilous position, and the
prospect of society in the reign of Nero, might well lead a
man of meditative turn so to prepare himself for a fate which
was always imminent. But the Stoic doctor could never
acquiesce in a mere negative ideal, the self-centred independence
of the individual soul. He was too cultivated, he
had drunk too deep of the science and philosophy of the
past, he had too wide an outlook over the facts of human life
and society, to relegate himself to a moral isolation which was
apt to become a state of brutal disregard of the claims of
social duty, and even of personal self-respect.<a id="noteref_1742" name="noteref_1742" href="#note_1742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1742</span></span></a> Such a position
was absolutely impossible to a man like Seneca. Whatever
his practice may have been, it is clear that in temperament he
was almost too soft and emotional. He was a man with an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>intense craving for sympathy, and lavish of it to others; he was
the last man in the world who could enjoy a solitary paradise
of self-satisfied perfection. It is true the Roman world to
the eyes of Seneca lay in the shadow of death, crushed under
a treacherous despotism, and enervated by gross indulgence.
Yet, although he sees men in this lurid light, he does not
scorn or hate them. It was not for nothing that Seneca had
been for five years the first minister of the Roman Empire.
To have stood so near the master of the world, and felt the
pulse of humanity from Britain to the Euphrates, to have
listened to their complaints and tried to minister to their needs,
was a rare education in social sympathy. It had a profound
effect on M. Aurelius, and it had left its mark on Seneca.<a id="noteref_1743" name="noteref_1743" href="#note_1743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1743</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two competing tendencies may be traced in Stoicism, and
in Seneca’s exposition of it. On the one hand, man must
seek the harmony of his nature by submitting his passions
and emotions to his own higher nature, and shaking himself free
from all bondage to the flesh or the world. On the other
hand, man is regarded as the subject of the universal Reason,
a member of the universal commonwealth, whose maker and
ruler is God.<a id="noteref_1744" name="noteref_1744" href="#note_1744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1744</span></span></a> The one view might make a man aim merely
at isolated perfection; it might produce the philosophic monk.
The other and broader conception of humanity would make man
seek his perfection, not only in personal virtue, but in active
sympathy with the movement of the world. The one impulse
would end in a kind of spiritual selfishness. The other
would seek for the full development of spiritual strength in
the mutual aid and sympathy of struggling humanity, in
friendship,<a id="noteref_1745" name="noteref_1745" href="#note_1745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1745</span></span></a> in the sense of a universal brotherhood and the
fatherhood of God. There are two cities, says Seneca, in
which a man may be enrolled—the great society of gods and
men, wide as the courses of the sun; the other, the Athens or
the Carthage to which we are assigned by the accident of
birth.<a id="noteref_1746" name="noteref_1746" href="#note_1746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1746</span></span></a> A man may give himself to the service of both
societies, or he may serve the one and neglect the other. The
wise man alone realises to the full his citizenship in the
spiritual commonwealth, in pondering on the problems of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>human conduct, the nature of the soul, of the universe and

himself exclusively to contemplation and moral self-culture.<a id="noteref_1747" name="noteref_1747" href="#note_1747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1747</span></span></a>
He may not, by wealth and station, have access to the arena of
active life. And, although a seeming recluse, he may really be
a far greater benefactor of his kind than if he led the Senate,
or commanded armies. There may be cases in which a man
may be right in turning his back on public life, in order to
concentrate all his energies on self-improvement. And Seneca
does not hesitate to counsel Lucilius to withdraw himself from
the thraldom of office.<a id="noteref_1748" name="noteref_1748" href="#note_1748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1748</span></span></a> Yet Zeno’s precept was that the

earthly commonwealth could he serve with consistency; is it
an Athens, which condemned a Socrates to death, and drove an

lofty idealism and the facts of human life, which is softened,
if not solved, from age to age by casuistry. The wise and
good man should have the springs of his happiness in himself.
Yet a wise friend may call forth his powers, and furnish an
object of self-sacrifice.<a id="noteref_1753" name="noteref_1753" href="#note_1753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1753</span></span></a> The wise man will not entangle

services to the State, unless there be some insuperable bar?
The controversy between the dream of solitary perfection and
altruism was variously solved, and the particular solution
could always be defended in the light of the great law of
life. Epictetus, cut off from the great world by servile birth
and poverty, could make light of marriage, of the begetting of
future citizens, and the duties of political life.<a id="noteref_1755" name="noteref_1755" href="#note_1755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1755</span></span></a> On the other
hand, M. Aurelius, by nature as detached as Epictetus, might
refuse to follow the transcendental counsels of Chrysippus and
Seneca. He might strive painfully to reconcile devotion to an
irksome political charge with a dream of that unseen commonwealth
<span class="tei tei-q">“in which the cities of men are as it were houses.”</span><a id="noteref_1756" name="noteref_1756" href="#note_1756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1756</span></span></a>

And as we shall not be harsh to those of our own external
rank, so shall we soften the lot of those whom fortune has
condemned to slavery. Even the slave is admitted to that
great city of gods and men, which has no frontiers, which
embraces all races and ranks, where all ranks should be
levelled by the consciousness of a common Divine descent and
a universal brotherhood of men.<a id="noteref_1776" name="noteref_1776" href="#note_1776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1776</span></span></a> The conquests of Macedon
and Rome, overthrowing all old-world national barriers, had
prepared the way for the greatest and most fruitful triumph
of ancient philosophy. And the Stoic school has the glory of
anticipating the diviner dream, yet far from realised, of a
human brotherhood under the light from the Cross. Seneca
has never risen higher, or swept farther into the future than
in his treatment of slavery. He is far in advance of many
a bishop or abbot or Christian baron of the middle age. Can
a slave confer a benefit? he asks.<a id="noteref_1777" name="noteref_1777" href="#note_1777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1777</span></span></a> Is his service, however

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from constraint, is undeserving of gratitude? Seneca repudiates
the base suggestion with genuine warmth. On
the same principle a subject cannot confer a benefit on his
monarch, a simple soldier on his general. There is a limit
beyond which power cannot command obedience. There is a
line between cringing compliance and generous self-sacrifice.
And the slave has often passed that limit. He has often borne
wounds and death to save his master’s life in battle. He has
often, in the years of the terror, endured the last extremity of
torture, rather than betray his secrets.<a id="noteref_1778" name="noteref_1778" href="#note_1778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1778</span></span></a> The body of the slave

sold. And in his inner soul, the slave is his master’s equal.
He is capable of equal virtue and equal culture; nay, in both he
may be his master’s superior. He can confer a benefit if he can
suffer injury in the outrages which cruelty and lust inflict upon
him. When he confers a benefit, he confers it as man upon
man, as an equal in the great family whose Father is God.

Seneca gives a lurid picture of the corruption of women in
the general licence of his age.<a id="noteref_1780" name="noteref_1780" href="#note_1780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1780</span></span></a> Yet he has a lofty ideal of
what women might become. Like other Stoic preachers, it
was his good fortune to be surrounded by good women from
his infancy. He remembers the tenderness of his aunt, in
whose arms he first entered Rome as a child, who nursed him
through long sickness, and broke through her reserve to help
him in his early career of ambition. Her blameless character
escaped even the petulance of Alexandrian gossip.<a id="noteref_1781" name="noteref_1781" href="#note_1781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1781</span></span></a> His letters
to his mother, Helvia, reveal a matron of the best Roman
type—strong, self-denying, proud of her motherhood, and
despising the extravagance and ostentation of her class. In
spite of her father’s limited idea of female culture, she had
educated herself in liberal studies, and found them a refuge
in affliction.<a id="noteref_1782" name="noteref_1782" href="#note_1782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1782</span></span></a> Marcia was of a softer type, and gave way to
excessive grief for a lost child. Yet it is to her that Seneca
unfolds most fully his ideal of feminine character. He will not
admit the inferior aptitude of women for virtue and culture.<a id="noteref_1783" name="noteref_1783" href="#note_1783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1783</span></span></a>

lofty ideal of woman’s character.<a id="noteref_1784" name="noteref_1784" href="#note_1784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1784</span></span></a> But to any true disciple of
the Porch that ideal had a surer ground than any personal
experience, however happy. The creed which Seneca held was
at once a levelling and an elevating creed. It found the only
nobility or claim to rank in higher capacity for virtue.<a id="noteref_1785" name="noteref_1785" href="#note_1785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1785</span></span></a> It

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now, in taking leave of Seneca, let us forget the
fawning exile in Corsica, the possible lover of Julia or
Agrippina, the millionaire minister of Nero, who was surrounded
by a luxury and state which moved the envy of the tyrant.<a id="noteref_1786" name="noteref_1786" href="#note_1786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1786</span></span></a>
Rather let us think of the ascetic from his early youth, who,
raised by his talents to the highest place, had to reconcile an
impossible ideal with the sordid or terrible realities of that rank
which was at once a <span class="tei tei-q">“pinnacle and a precipice.”</span><a id="noteref_1787" name="noteref_1787" href="#note_1787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1787</span></span></a> He was
continually torn by the contrast between the ideal of a lofty
Stoic creed and the facts of human life around him, between
his own spiritual cravings and the temptations or the necessities
of the opportunist statesman. He was imbued with principles
of life which could be fully realised only in some Platonic
Utopia; he had to deal with men as they were in the reign of
Nero, as they are painted by Tacitus and Petronius. If he
failed in the impossible task of such a reconciliation, let us do
him the justice of recognising that he kept his vision clear,
and that he has expounded a gospel of the higher life, which,
with all its limitations from temperament or tradition, will be
true for our remotest posterity, that he had a vision of the City
of God.<a id="noteref_1788" name="noteref_1788" href="#note_1788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1788</span></span></a> He was not personally perhaps so pure and clear a
soul as Plutarch or Aristides or Dion Chrysostom. But he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had utterly cast off that heathen anthropomorphism which
crossed and disturbed their highest visions of the Divine.<a id="noteref_1789" name="noteref_1789" href="#note_1789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1789</span></span></a>
Seneca is far more modern and advanced than even the
greatest of the Neo-Platonic school, just because he saw that
the old theology was hopelessly effete. He could never have
joined in the last struggle of philosophic paganism with
the Church. And so the Church almost claimed him as
her son, while it never dreamt of an affinity with Plutarch
or Plotinus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, there needed only the change of some phrases to
reconcile the teaching of Seneca with that of the great ascetic
Christian doctors. Many of the headings of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Imitation</span></span>
might be attached to paragraphs of Seneca—<span class="tei tei-q">“of bearing with
the faults of others”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of inordinate affections”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of the
love of solitude and silence”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of meditation on death”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of
humble submission”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“that to despise the world and serve
God is sweet”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of the acknowledgment of our own infirmities,
and the remembrance of God’s benefits”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of the contempt of
temporal honour and vain secular knowledge”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“of the day of
eternity and this life’s straitness.”</span> In truth, the great spirits
of all ages who have had a genius for religion, after due allowance
for difference of association and difference of phrase, are
strangely akin and harmonious. And Seneca had one great
superiority over other equally religious souls of his time, which
enables him to approach mediaeval and modern religious thought—he
had broken absolutely with paganism. He started with
belief in the God of the Stoic creed; he never mentions the
Stoic theology which attempted to reconcile Him with the
gods of the Pantheon. In spite of all his rhetoric, he tries to
see the facts of human life and the relation of the human spirit
to the Divine in the light of reason, with no intervening veil
of legend. God is to Seneca the great Reality, however halting
human speech may describe Him, as Fate, or Law, or Eternal
Reason, or watchful loving Providence. God is within us,
in whatever mysterious way, inspiring good resolves, giving
strength in temptation, with all-seeing eye watching the issue
of the struggle. God is without us, loading us with kindness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even when we offend, chastising us in mercy, the goal of all
speculation, He from whom we proceed, to whom we go at death.
The true worship of Him is not in formal prayer and sacrifice,
but in striving to know and imitate His infinite goodness.
We mortal men in our brief life on earth may be citizens of
two commonwealths, one the Rome or Corinth of our birth,
the other that great city of gods and men, in which all are
equally united, male and <a name="corr332" id="corr332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">female,</span> bond and free, as children
of a common Father. In this ideal citizenship, in obedience
to the law of the spiritual city, the eternal law which makes
for righteousness, man attains his true freedom and final
beatitude in communion with kindred souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, as in mediaeval and puritan religious theory, there is
in Seneca a strange conflict between pessimism and idealism.
To the doomed philosophic statesman of the reign of Nero, the
days of man’s life are few and evil. Life is but a moment in
the tract of infinite age, and so darkened by manifold sins and
sorrows that it seems, as it did to Sophocles, a sinister gift.<a id="noteref_1790" name="noteref_1790" href="#note_1790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1790</span></span></a>
On the other hand, its shortness is a matter of no importance;
the shortest life may be full and glad if it be dignified by
effort and resignation and conformity to the great law of the
universe. The wise and pious man, ever conscious of his brief
time of probation, may brighten each passing day into a
festival and lengthen it into a life. The shortness of a life is
only an illusion, for long or short have no meaning when
measured by the days of eternity. And the philosopher may
unite many lives in one brief span. He may join himself to
a company of sages who add their years to his, who counsel
without bitterness, and praise without flattery; he may be
adopted into a family whose wealth increases the more it is
divided; in him all the ages may be combined in a single life.<a id="noteref_1791" name="noteref_1791" href="#note_1791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1791</span></span></a>
To such a spirit death loses all its terrors. The eternal mystery
indeed can be pierced only by imaginative hope. Death, we
may be sure, however, can only be a change. It may be a
passage into calm unconsciousness, as before our birth, which
will release us from all the griefs and tumults of the life here
below. It may, on the other hand, prove to be the morning
of an eternal day, the entrance to a radiant and untroubled
world of infinite possibilities. In any case, the spirit which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has trained itself in obedience to eternal law, will not tremble
at a fate which is surely reserved for the universe, by fire
or flood or other cataclysmal change. The future in store for
the soul is either to dwell for ever among things divine, or
to sink back again into the general soul, and God shall be
all in all.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gospel of philosophy expounded by Seneca was rather an
esoteric or aristocratic creed. With all his liberal sentiment,
his cosmopolitanism, his clear conception of human equality
and brotherhood, Seneca always remains the director of souls
like his own, enervated by wealth, tortured with the ennui of
jaded sensibility, haunted by the terror of the Caesars.<a id="noteref_1792" name="noteref_1792" href="#note_1792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1792</span></span></a> Indeed
Stoicism was always rather a creed for the cultivated upper
class than for the crowd. In its prime, its apparatus of
logical formulae, its elaborate physics and metaphysics, its
essentially intellectual solution of the problems both of the
universe and human life, necessarily disabled it from ever
developing into a popular system. And in the later days
of the Republic, theory became more important than practice,
and logic passed into casuistry.<a id="noteref_1793" name="noteref_1793" href="#note_1793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1793</span></span></a> But in the first century,
Stoicism came to be much more a religion than a philosophy,
or even a theology. Its main business, as conceived by
men like Seneca, is to save souls from the universal shipwreck
of character<a id="noteref_1794" name="noteref_1794" href="#note_1794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1794</span></span></a> caused by the capricious excesses of
luxury, the idolatry of the world and the flesh, which
sprang from a riotous pride in the material advantages of
imperial power, without a sobering sense of duty or a moral
ideal. But, in the nature of things, this wreck of character
was most glaringly seen among the men who were in close
contact with the half insane masters of the world in the first
century, and who possessed the resources to exhaust the
possi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bilities of pleasure or the capacities of the senses to enjoy.
It is to people of this class, who still retained some lingering
instincts of goodness, weary with indulgence, bewildered and
tortured by the conflict of the lower nature with the weak,
but still disturbing, protests of the higher, that Seneca
addresses his counsels.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what of the great masses lying outside the circle of
cultivated and exhausted self-indulgence, that plebeian world
of which we have seen the picture in their municipalities and
colleges? It is clear from the records of their daily life, their
ambitions, their tasks and amusements, that, although perhaps
not generally tainted with such deep corruption as the nobles
of the Neronian age, their moral tone and aspirations hardly
correspond to the material splendour of the Empire. Even
apart from the glimpses of low life in Petronius, Martial,
and Apuleius, apart from the revelations of Pompeii, and the
ghastly traditions which haunt the ruins of countless theatres
and amphitheatres, the warnings of preachers of that age,
such as Dion Chrysostom, and the reflections of the infinitely
charitable M. Aurelius, leave no very favourable impression of
the moral condition of the masses.<a id="noteref_1795" name="noteref_1795" href="#note_1795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1795</span></span></a> How could it be otherwise?
The old paganism of Rome did indeed foster certain
ancestral pieties which were the salt of the Roman character.
But it unfortunately also gave its sanction to scenes of lust
and cruelty which went far to counteract in later times any
good it did. Nor had the old religion any means for edification
and the culture of character. It had no organisation for
the care and direction of souls in moral doubt and peril. If
its oracles might, from a few old-world examples, seem to
supply such a spiritual want, the appearance is delusive even
according to pagan testimony. Poets and moralists alike
thundered against the shameless impiety which often begged
the sanction of a prophetic shrine for some meditated sin,<a id="noteref_1796" name="noteref_1796" href="#note_1796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1796</span></span></a>
and the charge has been confirmed by the resurrection of these
old profanities from the ruins of Dodona.<a id="noteref_1797" name="noteref_1797" href="#note_1797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1797</span></span></a> But even without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>direct testimony, we might fairly conclude that the Antonine
Age was, by reason of its material development, in special
need of spiritual teaching and evangelism. The whole stress
of public and private effort was towards the provision of
comfort or splendour or amusement for the masses. And,
within the range of its ambition, it succeeded marvellously.
Nor should an impartial inquirer refuse to admit that such an
immense energy has its good moral side. The rich were
rigorously taught their duty to society, and they improved
upon the lesson. The masses responded to their generous
public spirit with gratitude and affection; and the universal
kindliness and fraternity diffused through all ranks on days of
high religious festival or civic interest, afforded a very wholesome
and gratifying spectacle.<a id="noteref_1798" name="noteref_1798" href="#note_1798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1798</span></span></a> There was an undoubted
softening of the Roman character. And the labours of the
great Stoic lawyers were giving expression to cultivated moral
feeling, in a more liberal recognition of the natural rights of
the weak and oppressed, of women and of slaves. Yet a
society may be humane and kindly while it is also worldly
and materialised. To us at least, the forces of the Antonine
age seem to have expended themselves chiefly on the popular
pleasures and external adornments of life, or a revival, often in
the grossest and most absurd forms, as we shall see in a later
chapter, of the superstitions of the past. With all its humanitarian
sentiment and all its material glories, the Roman world
had entered on that fatal incline, which, by an unperceived yet
irresistible movement, led on to the sterilisation of the higher
intellect, and the petrifaction of Roman society which ended in
the catastrophe of the fifth century.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The triumphs and splendour of corporate life in the age of
the Antonines are certainly a dazzling spectacle. Yet to the
student who is more occupied with the painful moral education
of the race, the interest lies in a different direction. It was
a worldly age, but it was also an age ennobled by a powerful
protest against worldliness. And in this chapter we shall
study a great movement, which, under the name of philosophy
or culture, called the masses of men to a higher standard of
life. This movement, like all others of the same kind, had its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impostors who disgraced it. Yet the man who has pursued
them with such mordant ridicule and pitiless scorn, the man
who was utterly sceptical as to the value of all philosophic
effort, in the last resort approaches very near to the view of
human life which was preached by the men whom he derides.<a id="noteref_1799" name="noteref_1799" href="#note_1799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1799</span></span></a>
Lucian belonged to no philosophic school; he would himself
have repudiated adhesion to any system. The advice of
Teiresias to Menippus, when he sought him in the shades,
would certainly have been Lucian’s to any young disciple who
consulted him. Have done with all these verbal subtleties and
chimeras; swear allegiance to no sect; make the best of the
present; and take things generally with a smile.<a id="noteref_1800" name="noteref_1800" href="#note_1800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1800</span></span></a> Yet who
can read the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span></span> without feeling that there
is a deeper and more serious vein in Lucian than he would
confess? Although he poured his contempt upon the Cynic
street preachers, although in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auction of Lives</span></span> the Cynic’s
sells for the most paltry price, the Cynic alone is allowed to
carry with him across the river of death his characteristic
qualities, his boldness and freedom of speech, his bitter
laughter at the follies and illusions of mankind.<a id="noteref_1801" name="noteref_1801" href="#note_1801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1801</span></span></a> There
are many indications in these dialogues that, if Lucian had
turned Cynic preacher, he would have waged the same war on
the pleasures and illusory ambitions of man, he would have
outdone the Cynics in brutal frankness of exposure and denunciation,
as he would have surpassed them in rhetorical and
imaginative charm of style.<a id="noteref_1802" name="noteref_1802" href="#note_1802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1802</span></span></a> He has a vivid and awful conception
of Death, the great leveller, and sees all earthly wealth
and glory in the grey light of the land where all things are
forgotten. Rank and riches, beauty and strength, the lust of
the eye and the pride of life, are all left behind on the borders
of the realm of <span class="tei tei-q">“sapless heads.”</span><a id="noteref_1803" name="noteref_1803" href="#note_1803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1803</span></span></a> If Lucian has any gospel it
is that the kingdom of heaven belongs to the poor. He is as
ready as some of the Christian Fathers to condemn the rich
eternally.<a id="noteref_1804" name="noteref_1804" href="#note_1804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1804</span></span></a> And therefore we are not surprised that Lucian
has little eye for the splendour of his age, unless indeed in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">“Great cities die as well as men.”</span><a id="noteref_1805" name="noteref_1805" href="#note_1805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1805</span></span></a> He seems to
have little appreciation for its real services to humanity. Its
vain, pretentious philosophy, its selfishness of wealth, its vices
hidden under the guise of virtue, drew down his hatred and
scorn. Yet one cannot help feeling, in reading some of Lucian’s
pieces, that, man of genius as he was, a man of no age, or a
man of all ages, he is looking at human life from far above,
with no limitations of time, and passing a judgment which
may be repeated in the thirtieth century.<a id="noteref_1806" name="noteref_1806" href="#note_1806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1806</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This lofty or airy detachment in regarding the toils and
ambitions of men is perhaps best seen in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charon</span></span>. In this
piece Lucian shows us the ideal spectator taking an outlook
over the scene of human life. The ferryman of the dead,
who has heard so many laments from his passengers for the
joys they have lost, wishes to have a glance at this upper
world which it seems so hard to leave behind. He joins
the company of Hermes, and, by an old-world miracle, they
gain an observatory on high-piled Thessalian mountains from
which to watch for a while the comedy or the tragedy of
human life.<a id="noteref_1807" name="noteref_1807" href="#note_1807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1807</span></span></a> A magic verse of Homer gives the spectral
visitor the power to observe the scene so far below. And
what a sight it is! It is a confused spectacle of various effort
and passion—men sailing, fighting, ploughing, lending at usury,
suing in the law-courts. It is also a human swarm stinging
and being stung. And over all the scene flits a confused cloud
of hopes and fears and follies and hatreds, the love of pleasure
and the love of gold. Higher still, you may see the eternal
Fates spinning for each one of the motley crowd his several
thread. One man, raised high for the moment, has a resounding
fall; another, mounting but a little way, sinks unperceived.
And amidst all the tumult and excitement of their hopes and
alarms, death kindly snatches them away by one of his many
messengers. Yet they weep and lament, forgetting that they
have been mere sojourners for a brief space upon earth and
are only losing the pleasures of a dream.<a id="noteref_1808" name="noteref_1808" href="#note_1808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1808</span></span></a> To Charon the
bubbles in a fountain are the truest image of their phantom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life—some forming and bursting speedily, others swelling out
for a little longer and more showy life, but all bursting at the
last. Charon is so moved by the pathos of it all, that, from
his mountain peaks, he would fain preach a sermon to the silly
crowd and warn them of the doom which is in store for all.
But the wiser or more cynical Hermes tells him that all
except a few have their ears more closely stopped than the
crew of Odysseus when they passed the Siren isles.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This view of human life, half-contemptuous, half-pathetic,
which the great iconoclast of all the dreams of religion or
philosophy in his time has sketched with his own graphic
power, was the view of the very philosophy which he derided.
Philosophy had a second time turned from heaven to earth.
The effort to solve the riddle of the universe by a single
formula, or by the fine-drawn subtleties of dialectic, has been
abandoned. In Lucian’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auction of Lives</span></span>, in which the merits
of the various schools are balanced and estimated in terms
of cash, it is significant that only a slight and perfunctory
reference is made to the great cosmic or metaphysical theories
of Elea or Ionia, to the Pythagorean doctrine of numbers, to
the Ephesian doctrine of the eternal flow, or the ideal system
of Plato.<a id="noteref_1809" name="noteref_1809" href="#note_1809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1809</span></span></a> We have seen that, although Seneca has a certain
interest in the logic and physics of the older Stoicism, he
makes all purely speculative inquiry ancillary to moral progress.
The same diversion of interest from the field of speculation to
that of conduct is seen even more decidedly in Epictetus and
M. Aurelius.<a id="noteref_1810" name="noteref_1810" href="#note_1810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1810</span></span></a> The philosophic Emperor had, of course, studied
the great cosmic systems of Heraclitus and Epicurus, Plato
and Aristotle.<a id="noteref_1811" name="noteref_1811" href="#note_1811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1811</span></span></a> They furnish a scenery or background, sometimes,
especially that of Heraclitus, a dimly-seen foundation,
for his theory of conduct. But, in spite of his sad, weary view
of the pettiness and sameness of the brief space of consciousness
between <span class="tei tei-q">“the two eternities,”</span> the whole thought of M.
Aurelius is concentrated on the manner in which that brief
moment may be worthily spent. So, Epictetus asks, What do
I care whether all things are composed of atoms or similar
parts or of fire or earth? Is it not enough to know the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nature of good and evil?<a id="noteref_1812" name="noteref_1812" href="#note_1812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1812</span></span></a> Just as in the days of Socrates
the whole stress of philosophy is directed towards the discovery
of a rule of life, a source of moral clearness and guidance,
with a view to the formation or reformation of character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca and Epictetus and Lucian and M. Aurelius all alike
give a gloomy picture of the moral condition of the masses.
And we may well believe that, in spite of the splendour of
that age, in spite of a great moral movement which was stirring
among the leaders of society, the mass of men, as in every age,
had little taste for idealist views of life. Yet Seneca, notwithstanding
his pessimism, speaks of the multitudes who were
stretching out their hands for moral help. There must have
been some demand for that popular moral teaching which is a
striking feature of the time. Men might jeer at the philosophic
missionary, but they seem to have crowded to listen to him—on
the temple steps of Rome or Ephesus, in the great squares
of Alexandria,<a id="noteref_1813" name="noteref_1813" href="#note_1813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1813</span></span></a> or in the colonnades at Olympia, or under the
half-ruined walls of an old Milesian colony on the Euxine.<a id="noteref_1814" name="noteref_1814" href="#note_1814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1814</span></span></a>
The rush of the porters and smiths and carpenters to join the
ranks of the Cynic friars, which moved the scorn of Lucian,<a id="noteref_1815" name="noteref_1815" href="#note_1815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1815</span></span></a> must
have corresponded to some general demand, even if the motive
of the vagrant missionary was not of the purest kind. There
must have been many an example of moral earnestness like
that of Hermotimus, who had laboured hard for twenty years
to find the true way of life, and had only obtained a distant
glimpse of the celestial city.<a id="noteref_1816" name="noteref_1816" href="#note_1816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1816</span></span></a> After Dion’s conversion, as we
may fairly call it, he deems it a sacred duty to call men to the
way of wisdom by persuasion or reproach, and to appeal even
to the turbulent masses.<a id="noteref_1817" name="noteref_1817" href="#note_1817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1817</span></span></a> We shall see how well he fulfilled
the duty. For nearly a century at Athens, the gentle Demonax
embodied the ideal which his friend Epictetus had
formed of the Cynic father of all men in God; and his immense
ascendency testifies at least to a widespread respect and
admiration for such teaching and example.<a id="noteref_1818" name="noteref_1818" href="#note_1818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1818</span></span></a> It is not necessary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to suppose that the people who thought it an honour if
Demonax invited himself to their tables, the magistrates who
rose up to do him reverence as he passed, or the riotous
assembly which was awed into stillness by his mere presence,
were people generally who had caught his moral enthusiasm.<a id="noteref_1819" name="noteref_1819" href="#note_1819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1819</span></span></a>
They were at the very time eager to have gladiatorial shows
established under the shadow of the Acropolis. But it is something
when men begin to revere a character inspired by moral
forces of which they have only a dim conjecture. And amid all
the material splendour and apparent content of the Antonine age,
there were signs that men were becoming conscious of a great
spiritual need, which they often tried to satisfy by accumulated
superstitions. The ancient routine was broken up; the forms
of ancestral piety no longer satisfied even the vulgar; the forms
of ancient scholastic speculation had become stale and frigid
to the cultivated; the old philosophies had left men bewildered.
Henceforth, philosophy must make itself a religion; the philosopher
must become an <span class="tei tei-q">“ambassador of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is no philosophy without virtue; there is no virtue
without philosophy,”</span> said Seneca,<a id="noteref_1820" name="noteref_1820" href="#note_1820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1820</span></span></a> and herein he expressed truly
the most earnest thought of his own age and the next. Lucian,
in the dialogue which is perhaps his most powerful exposure of
the failure of philosophy, bears testimony to the boundless expectations
which it aroused in its votaries. Hermotimus, the
elderly enthusiast, whom the mocker meets hurrying with his
books to the philosophic school, has been an ardent student for
twenty years; he has grown pale and withered with eager
thought. Yet he admits that he has only taken a single step on
the steep upward road. Few and faint and weary are they who
ever reach the summit.<a id="noteref_1821" name="noteref_1821" href="#note_1821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1821</span></span></a> Yet Hermotimus is content if, at the
close of the efforts of a lifetime, he should, if but for a moment,
breathe the air of the far-off heights and look down on the
human ant-hill below. Such spirits dream of an apotheosis like
that which crowned the hero on Mount Oeta, when the soul
shall be purged of its earthly passions as by fire, and hardly a
memory of the illusions of the past will remain.<a id="noteref_1822" name="noteref_1822" href="#note_1822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1822</span></span></a> Lycinus, his
friend, has once himself had a vision of a celestial city, from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which ambition and the greed of gold are banished, where there
is no discord or strife, but the citizens live in a deep peace of
sober virtue. He had once heard from an aged man how any
one might share its citizenship, rich or poor, bond or free, Greek
or barbarian, if only he had the passion for nobleness and were
not overcome by the hardness of the journey. And the sceptic
avows that long since he would have enrolled himself among
its citizens, but the city is far off, and only dimly visible.
The paths which are said to lead to it run in the most various
directions, through soft meadows and cool shaded slopes, or
mounting over bare rough crags under a pitiless blaze. And
at the entrance to each avenue there is a clamorous crowd of
guides, each vaunting his peculiar skill, abusing his rivals, and
pointing to the one sure access of which he alone has the
secret key. A similar scene, equally illustrative of the moral
ferment of the time, is sketched in another charming piece.<a id="noteref_1823" name="noteref_1823" href="#note_1823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1823</span></span></a>
It is that in which the rustic Pan, with his memories of the
shepherd’s pipe and the peace of Arcadian pastures, describes
the strange turmoil of contending sects which rings around his
cave on the edge of the Acropolis. There, in the Agora below,
rival teachers, with dripping brow and distended veins, are
shouting one another down before an admiring crowd. And
the simple old deity, to whom the language of their dialectic
is strange, seems to think that the victory rests with the loudest
voice and the most blatant self-assertion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sly ridicule of Lucian, so often crossed by a touch
of pathos, is perhaps the best testimony to the overpowering
interest which his age felt in the philosophy of conduct. And
it was no longer the pursuit merely of an intellectual aristocracy.
Common, ignorant folk have caught the passion for apostleship.
Everywhere might be met the familiar figure, with long
cloak and staff and scrip, haranguing in the squares or lanes to
unlettered crowds.<a id="noteref_1824" name="noteref_1824" href="#note_1824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1824</span></span></a> And the preacher is often as unlearned as

more or less sincerity. Lucian makes sport of the quarrels
and contradictions of the schools. And it is true that the old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>names still marked men off in different camps, or rather

seem to be personal, the offspring of very unphilosophic
ambition and jealousy, or greed or petty vanity, rather than the
wholesome and stimulating collision of earnest minds contending
for what they think a great system of truth. The rival
Sophists under the Acropolis were quarrelling for an audience
and not for a dogma. Scientific interest in philosophy was to
a great extent dead. For centuries no great original thinker
had arisen to rekindle it. And in the purely moral sphere
to which philosophy was now confined, the natural tendency of
the different schools, not even excluding the Epicurean, was
to assimilation and eclecticism.<a id="noteref_1827" name="noteref_1827" href="#note_1827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1827</span></span></a> They were all impartially
endowed at the university of Athens, and a youth of enthusiasm
would attend the professors of all the schools. Apollonius,
although he finally adopted the Pythagorean discipline, pursued
his studies at Aegae under Platonists and Stoics,<a id="noteref_1828" name="noteref_1828" href="#note_1828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1828</span></span></a> and even under
Epicureans. Seneca came under Pythagorean influences in his
youth, and he constantly rounds off a letter to Lucilius with
a quotation from Epicurus. Among the tutors of M. Aurelius
were the Peripatetic Claudius Severus, and Sextus the Platonist
of Chaeronea.<a id="noteref_1829" name="noteref_1829" href="#note_1829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1829</span></span></a> Hence, although a man in the second century
might be labelled Platonist or Stoic, Cynic or Pythagorean, it
would often be difficult from his moral teaching to discover
his philosophic ancestry and affinities. And, just as in modern
Christendom, although sectarian landmarks and designations are
kept up, the popular preaching of nearly all the sects tends to a
certain uniformity of emphasis on a limited number of momentous
moral truths, so the preaching of pagan philosophy dwells, almost
to weariness, on the same eternal principles of true gain and loss,
of the illusions of passion, of freedom through renunciation.

The moral teaching or preaching of the Antonine age
naturally adapted its tone to the tastes of its audience; there
was the discourse of the lecture-room, and the ruder and
more boisterous appeal to the crowd. Both passed under the
name of philosophy, and both often degraded that great name
by an affectation and insincerity which cast discredit on a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>great and beneficent movement of reform. The philosophic
lecturer who has a serious moral purpose is in theory distinguished
from the rhetorical sophist, who trades in startling
effects, who rejoices in displaying his skill on any subject
however trivial or grotesque, who will expatiate on the gnat or
the parrot, or debate the propriety of a Vestal’s marriage.<a id="noteref_1830" name="noteref_1830" href="#note_1830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1830</span></span></a> The
exercises of the rhetorical school had gone on for five hundred
years, and, with momentous effects on Roman culture, they
were destined to continue with little change till the Goths
were masters of Rome.<a id="noteref_1831" name="noteref_1831" href="#note_1831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1831</span></span></a> The greed, the frivolity, and the
overweening vanity of these intellectual acrobats are a
commonplace of literary history.<a id="noteref_1832" name="noteref_1832" href="#note_1832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1832</span></span></a> The sophist and the
lecturing philosopher were theoretically distinct. But unfortunately
a mass of evidence goes to show that in many
cases the lecturing philosopher became a mere showy rhetorician.
A similar desecration of a serious mission is not
unknown in modern times. The fault is often not with the
preacher, but with his audience. If people come not to be
made better, but to be amused, to have their ears soothed by
flowing declamation, to have a shallow intellectual curiosity
titillated by cheap displays of verbal subtlety or novelty,
the unfortunate preacher will often descend to the level of
his audience. And in that ancient world, according to the
testimony of Seneca, Musonius, Plutarch, and Epictetus, the
philosophic preacher too often was tempted to win a vulgar
applause by vulgar rhetorical arts.<a id="noteref_1833" name="noteref_1833" href="#note_1833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1833</span></span></a> He was sometimes a
man of no very serious purpose, with little real science or
originality. He had been trained in the school of rhetoric,
which abhorred all serious thought, and deified the master of
luscious periods and ingenious turns of phrase. He was,
besides, too often a mere vain and mercenary adventurer, trading
on an attenuated stock of philosophic tradition, and a boundless
command of a versatile rhetoric, cultivating intellectual
insolence as a fine art, yet with a servile craving for the
applause of his audience.<a id="noteref_1834" name="noteref_1834" href="#note_1834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1834</span></span></a> Many a scene in the now faded
history of their failures or futile triumphs comes down to us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from Plutarch and Epictetus and Philostratus.<a id="noteref_1835" name="noteref_1835" href="#note_1835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1835</span></span></a> Sometimes
the gaps upon the benches, the listless, inattentive air, the
slow feeble applause, sent the vain preacher home with gloomy
fears for his popularity. On other days, he was lifted to the
seventh heaven by an enthusiastic genteel mob, who followed
every deft turn of expression with shouts and gestures of delight,
and far-fetched preciosities of approbation. At the close, the
philosophic performer goes about among his admirers to
receive their renewed tribute. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, what did you think of
me?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Quite marvellous, I swear by all that is dear to me.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“But

nymphs?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, superlative!”</span> It is thus that a real winner
of souls describes the impostor.<a id="noteref_1836" name="noteref_1836" href="#note_1836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1836</span></span></a> Even estimable teachers did
not disdain to add to the effect of their lectures by carefully
polished eloquence, an exquisite toilet, and a cultivated dignity.
Such a courtly philosopher was Euphrates, the Syrian Stoic,
whose acquaintance Pliny had made during his term of service in
the East. Euphrates was stately and handsome, with flowing
hair and beard, and a demeanour which excited reverence without
overawing the hearer.<a id="noteref_1837" name="noteref_1837" href="#note_1837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1837</span></span></a> Irreproachable in his own life, he
condemned sin, but was merciful to the sinner. Pliny, the
amiable man of the world, who had no serious vices to reform,
found Euphrates a charming lecturer, with a subtle and ornate
style which was entirely to his taste. He treats Euphrates as
a rhetorician rather than as a philosopher with a solemn
message to deliver. To serious moralists like Seneca, Musonius,
Plutarch, and Epictetus the showy professor of the art of
arts was an offence. With their lofty conception of the task
of practical philosophy, they could only feel contempt or
indignation for the polished exquisite who trimmed or inflated
his periods to please the ears of fashionable audiences. They all
condemn such performances in almost identical terms. The
mission of true philosophy is to make men examine themselves,
to excite shame and pain and penitence, to reveal a law of life
and moral freedom which may lead to amendment and peace.<a id="noteref_1838" name="noteref_1838" href="#note_1838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1838</span></span></a>

such discourses, when the fate of character is at stake, is to
turn the school into a theatre or a music-hall, the philosopher
into a flute-player.<a id="noteref_1839" name="noteref_1839" href="#note_1839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1839</span></span></a>

The volume and unanimity of these criticisms of the rhetorical
philosopher show that such men abounded; but they also
show that there must have been a great mass of serious teachers
whom they travestied. It has perhaps been too little recognised
that in the first and second centuries there was a great propaganda
of pagan morality running parallel to the evangelism
of the Church.<a id="noteref_1840" name="noteref_1840" href="#note_1840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1840</span></span></a> The preaching was of very different kinds,
according to the character of the audiences. The preachers,
as we have said, belonged to all the different schools, Stoic or
Platonist, Cynic or Pythagorean; sometimes, like Dion, they
owed little academic allegiance at all. Sometimes the preaching
approached to modern conceptions of its office;<a id="noteref_1841" name="noteref_1841" href="#note_1841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1841</span></span></a> at others, it

The life of Apollonius of Tyana may be a romance; it
certainly contains many narratives of miracles and wonders
which cast a suspicion upon its historical value. Yet even
a romance must have real facts behind to give it probability,
and the preaching, at least, of Apollonius seems to belong to
the world of reality. Apollonius was probably much nearer
to the true ecclesiastic and priest of modern times than any
ancient preacher. He had been trained in all the philosophies;
he had drunk inspiration from the fountain of all spiritual
religion, the East. He was both a mystic and a ritualist. He
rejoiced in converse with the Brahmans, and he occupied
himself with the revival or reform of the ritual in countless
Greek and Italian temples.<a id="noteref_1843" name="noteref_1843" href="#note_1843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1843</span></span></a> He had an immense and curious
faith in ancient legend.<a id="noteref_1844" name="noteref_1844" href="#note_1844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1844</span></span></a> The man who could busy himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the restoration of the true antique form of an obsolete
rite at Eleusis or Athens or Dodona, also held conceptions of
prayer and sacrifice and mystic communion with God, which
might seem irreconcilable with any rigidly formal worship.<a id="noteref_1845" name="noteref_1845" href="#note_1845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1845</span></span></a>
The ritualist was also the preacher of a higher morality. From
the steps of the temples he used to address great audiences on
their conspicuous faults, as Dion did after him. In the parable
of the sparrow who by his twitter called his brethren to a heap
of spilt grain, he taught the people of Ephesus the duty of
brotherly helpfulness.<a id="noteref_1846" name="noteref_1846" href="#note_1846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1846</span></span></a> He found Smyrna torn by factious
strife, and he preached a rivalry of public spirit.<a id="noteref_1847" name="noteref_1847" href="#note_1847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1847</span></span></a> Even at
Olympia, before a crowd intent on the strife of racers and
boxers and athletes, he discoursed on wisdom and courage
and temperance.<a id="noteref_1848" name="noteref_1848" href="#note_1848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1848</span></span></a> At Rome, under the tyranny of Nero, he

preaching had we cannot tell—who can tell at any time? But
there are well-attested cases of individual conversion under
pagan preaching. Polemon, the son of a rich Athenian, was
a very dissolute youth who squandered his wealth on low
pleasure. Once, coming from some revel, he burst with his
companions into the lecture room of Xenocrates, who happened
to be discoursing on temperance. Xenocrates calmly continued
his remarks. The tipsy youth listened for a while,
then flung away his garland, and with it also his evil ways;<a id="noteref_1851" name="noteref_1851" href="#note_1851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1851</span></span></a>
he became the head of the Academy. A similar change was
wrought by the teaching of Apollonius on a debauched youth
of Corcyra, which we need not doubt although it was accompanied
by a miracle.<a id="noteref_1852" name="noteref_1852" href="#note_1852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1852</span></span></a>

Musonius, another preacher, was a younger contemporary
of Apollonius. His fame as an apostle of the philosophic life
aroused the suspicions of Nero, and he was exiled to Gyarus.<a id="noteref_1853" name="noteref_1853" href="#note_1853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1853</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The suspicion may have been confirmed by his intimacy
with Rubellius Plautus and great Stoics like Thrasea.<a id="noteref_1854" name="noteref_1854" href="#note_1854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1854</span></span></a> He
met with gentler treatment under the Flavians,<a id="noteref_1855" name="noteref_1855" href="#note_1855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1855</span></span></a> and he probably
saw the reign of Trajan. He is not known to have written
anything. The fragments of his teaching in Stobaeus are
probably drawn from notes of his lectures, as the teaching of
Epictetus has been preserved by Arrian. Musonius is not a
speculative philosopher but a physician of souls. Philosophy
is the way to goodness: goodness is the goal of philosophy.
And philosophy is not the monopoly of an intellectual caste;
it is a matter of precept and practice, not of theory. The true
moral teacher, working on the germ of virtue which there
is in each human soul, thinking only of reforming his disciples,
and nothing of applause, may win them to his ideal. Musonius
fortified the austere Stoic and Cynic precepts by the ascetic
discipline of the Pythagorean school. He taught the forgiveness
of injuries and gentleness to wrongdoers. He is one of the few
in the ancient world who have a glimpse of a remote ideal
of sexual virtue. While his ascetic principles do not lead him
to look askance at honourable marriage, he denounces all
unchastity, and demands equal virtue in man and woman.<a id="noteref_1856" name="noteref_1856" href="#note_1856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1856</span></span></a>
He was, according to Epictetus, a searching preacher. He spoke
to the conscience, so that each hearer felt as if his own faults
were set before his eyes. His name will go down for ever in the
pages of Tacitus. When the troops of Vespasian and Vitellius
were fighting in the lanes and gardens under the walls of Rome,
Musonius joined the envoys of the Senate, and at the risk of
his life harangued the infuriated soldiery on the blessings of
peace and the horrors of civil war.<a id="noteref_1857" name="noteref_1857" href="#note_1857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1857</span></span></a> Many of the moral
treatises of Plutarch are probably redacted from notes of
lectures delivered in Rome. As we shall see in a later chapter,
Plutarch is rather a moral director and theologian than a
preacher. But his wide knowledge of human nature, his keen
analysis of character and motive and human weakness, his
spiritual discernment in discovering remedies and sources of
strength, above all his lofty moral ideal, would have made him
a powerful preacher in any age of the world. But it is in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the discourses of Maximus of Tyre that we have perhaps the
nearest approach in antiquity to our conception of the sermon.
Probably if any of us were asked to explain that conception,
he might say that a sermon was founded on some definite idea
of the relation of man to the Infinite Spirit, that its object
was, on the one hand, to bring man into communion with God,
and, on the other, to teach him his duty to his fellowmen and
to himself. The discourses of Maximus have all these
characteristics. Maximus of Tyre is little known now, and
although to the historian of thought and moral life he is
attractive, he has not the strength of a great personality. Yet,
along with Plutarch, he shows us paganism at its best, striving
to reform itself, groping after new sources of spiritual strength,
trying to wed new and purer spiritual ideals to the worn-out
mythology of the past. Maximus is very much in the position
of one of our divines who finds himself bound in duty to edify
the spiritual life of his flock, without disowning the religious
traditions of the past, and without refusing to accept the ever-broadening
revelation of God. Some of his discourses may
seem to us frigid and scholastic, with a literary rather than
a religious interest. But in others, there is a combination of a
systematic theology with a mystic fervour and a moral purpose,
which seems hardly to belong to the ancient world.<a id="noteref_1858" name="noteref_1858" href="#note_1858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1858</span></span></a>

In his oration to the Alexandrians,<a id="noteref_1859" name="noteref_1859" href="#note_1859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1859</span></span></a> Dion Chrysostom speaks
with unwonted asperity of the Cynics, haranguing with coarse
buffoonery a gaping crowd in the squares and alleys or in the
porches of the temples. He thinks that these men are doing
no good, but rather bringing the name of philosophy into
contempt. It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that
this view of the Cynic profession was very general in that age.
The vulgar Cynic, with his unkempt beard, his mantle, wallet,
and staff, his filth and rudeness and obscenity, insulting every
passer-by with insolent questions, exchanging coarse jests and
jeers with the vagabond mob which gathers at his approach,
is the commonest figure in Greek and Roman literature of the
time. The <span class="tei tei-q">“mendicant monks”</span> of paganism have been painted
with all the vices of the dog and ape by Martial and Petronius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Seneca, by Dion and Athenaeus and Alciphron and
Epictetus, above all by Lucian.<a id="noteref_1860" name="noteref_1860" href="#note_1860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1860</span></span></a> The great foe of all extravagance
or enthusiasm in religion and philosophy fastened on
the later followers of Diogenes with peculiar bitterness. His
hostility, we may surmise, is directed not against their tenets,
but their want of decent culture. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banquet</span></span>, the Cynic
Alcidamas is drawn with a coarse vigour of touch which is
intended to match the coarseness of the subject. He bursts
into the dinner-party of Aristaenetus uninvited, to the terror
of the company, ranges about the room, snatching tit-bits
from the dishes as they pass him, and finally sinks down
upon the floor beside a mighty flagon of strong wine. He
drinks to the bride in no elegant fashion, challenges the
jester to fight, and, when the lamp is extinguished in the
obscene tumult, is finally found trying to embrace the
dancing girl.<a id="noteref_1861" name="noteref_1861" href="#note_1861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1861</span></span></a> But Lucian’s bitterest attack on the class is
perhaps delivered in the dialogue entitled the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fugitives</span></span>.
Philosophy, in the form of a woman bathed in tears, appears
before the Father of the gods. That kindly potentate is
affected by her grief, and inquires the cause of it. Philosophy,
who had been commissioned by Zeus to bring healing and
peace to human life in all its confusion and ignorance and
violence, then unfolds the tale of her wrongs.<a id="noteref_1862" name="noteref_1862" href="#note_1862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1862</span></span></a> It is a
picture of vulgar pretence, by which her fair name has been
besmirched and disgraced. Observing the love and reverence
which her true servants may win from men, a base crew of
ignorant fellows, trained in the lowest handicrafts, have forsaken
them, to assume the garb and name of her real followers.<a id="noteref_1863" name="noteref_1863" href="#note_1863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1863</span></span></a>
It is a pleasant change from a life of toil and danger and
hardship, to an easy vagabond existence, nor is the transformation
difficult. A cloak and a club, a loud voice and a
brazen face and a copious vocabulary of scurrilous abuse,
these are all the necessary equipment. Impudent assurance
has its usual success with the crowd, who are unable to see
through the disguise. If any one attempts to challenge the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>claims of the impostors, he is answered with a blow or a taunt.
And thus by terrorism or deceit, they usurp the respect which
is due to the real philosopher, and manage to live in plenty and
even in luxury. Nor is this the worst. For these pretended
ascetics, who profess to scorn delights, and to endure all
manner of hardness, are really coarse common sensualists,
who go about corrupting and seducing. Many of them heap
up a fortune in their wanderings, and then bid farewell to scrip
and cloak and the tub of Diogenes. And so plain unlearned
men come to regard the very name of philosophy with hatred
and contempt, and all her work is undone, like another
Penelope’s web.<a id="noteref_1864" name="noteref_1864" href="#note_1864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1864</span></span></a>

Even the stoutest defender of the Cynic movement, as a
whole, feels constrained to admit that the charges against the
Cynics were, perhaps, in many cases, true.<a id="noteref_1865" name="noteref_1865" href="#note_1865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1865</span></span></a> It was a movement
peculiarly attractive to the lawless, restless hangers-on
of society, who found in an open defiance of social restraints
and a wandering existence, a field of licence and a chance of
gain. Some of the great Cynics, indeed, were interested in
physical speculation, and were widely cultivated men.<a id="noteref_1866" name="noteref_1866" href="#note_1866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1866</span></span></a> But
the Cynic movement, as a whole, rested on no scientific tradition,
and the most serious and effective preacher of its doctrine
needed only a firm hold of a few simple truths, with a command
of seizing and incisive phrase.<a id="noteref_1867" name="noteref_1867" href="#note_1867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1867</span></span></a> There was no professional
barrier to exclude the ignorant and corrupt pretender.
For the Cynics, from the very nature of their mission and
their aims, never formed an organised school or society.
Each went his own way in complete detachment. To the
superficial observer, the only common bond and characteristic
were the purely external marks of dress and rough
bearing and ostentatious contempt for the most ordinary
comforts and decencies of life, which could easily be assumed
by the knave and the libertine. Hence, as time went on,
although good Cynics, like Demonax or Demetrius, acquired
a deserved influence, yet the greed, licentiousness, and brutal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>violence of others brought great discredit on the name.
Epictetus, who had a lofty ideal of the Cynic preacher
as an ambassador of God, lays bare the coarse vices of the
pretender to that high service with an unsparing hand.<a id="noteref_1868" name="noteref_1868" href="#note_1868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1868</span></span></a> It is
evident, however, that certain of the gravest imputations,
which had been developed by prurient imaginations, were, by
an unwholesome tradition, levelled at even the greatest and best
of the Cynics.<a id="noteref_1869" name="noteref_1869" href="#note_1869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1869</span></span></a> And S. Augustine, in referring to these foul
charges, affirms, with an honourable candour, that they could
not be truly made against the Cynics of his own day.<a id="noteref_1870" name="noteref_1870" href="#note_1870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1870</span></span></a> Moreover,

philosophy.<a id="noteref_1871" name="noteref_1871" href="#note_1871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1871</span></span></a> Even M. Aurelius could not altogether disarm
the suspicion with which it was regarded. And the revolt of
Avidius Cassius was to some extent an outburst of impatience
with the doctrinaire spirit of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philosopha anicula</span></span>, as Cassius

movement which specially tended to provoke the ordinary
man. It threw down the gauntlet to a materialised age. It
preached absolute renunciation of all social ties and duties, and
of all the pleasures and refinements with which that society
had surrounded itself. In an age which, even on its tomb-stones,
bears the stamp of a starched conventionality and
adherence to use and wont, the Cynic was a defiant rebel
against all social restraints. In an age which was becoming
ever more superstitious, he did not shrink from attacking the
faith in the gods, the efficacy of the mysteries, the credit of
the most ancient oracles.<a id="noteref_1873" name="noteref_1873" href="#note_1873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1873</span></span></a> And, finally, while philosophy in

till the Syrian dynasty of the third century.<a id="noteref_1874" name="noteref_1874" href="#note_1874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1874</span></span></a> We have here

provoking it.

A good example of the merciless, and not altogether
scrupulous fashion in which the Cynics were handled by contemporaries
is to be found in Lucian’s piece on the death of
Peregrinus.<a id="noteref_1875" name="noteref_1875" href="#note_1875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1875</span></span></a> Peregrinus was a native of Parium on the Propontis,

justified his assumption of the name.<a id="noteref_1876" name="noteref_1876" href="#note_1876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1876</span></span></a> On reaching manhood,
he wandered from land to land, and in Palestine he joined a
Christian brotherhood, in which he rose to a commanding
influence, which drew down the suspicion of the government,
and he was thrown for a time into prison.<a id="noteref_1877" name="noteref_1877" href="#note_1877"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1877</span></span></a> His persecution
called forth, as Lucian ungrudgingly admits, all the fearless
love and charity of the worshippers of <span class="tei tei-q">“the crucified Sophist.”</span>
Released by a philosophic governor of the type of Gallio, he
gave up the remnant of his paternal property, amounting to
fifteen talents, to his native city.<a id="noteref_1878" name="noteref_1878" href="#note_1878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1878</span></span></a> Peregrinus had already
assumed the peculiar dress of the Cynic, and set out on fresh
wanderings, having, from some difference on a point of ritual,
severed his connection with the Christian brotherhood. He
then came under the influence of an Egyptian ascetic and of
the mysticism of the East. In a visit to Italy he acquired
celebrity by his fierce invectives, which did not spare even
the blameless and gentle Antoninus Pius.<a id="noteref_1879" name="noteref_1879" href="#note_1879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1879</span></span></a> The Emperor himself
paid little heed to him, but the prefect of the city thought
that Rome could well spare such a philosopher, and Peregrinus
was obliged to return to the East. Henceforth Greece, and
especially Elis, was the scene of his labours. He abated
none of his energy, dealing out his denunciations impartially,
and not sparing even the philosophic millionaire Herodes
Atticus for providing the visitors to Olympia with the luxury
of pure water.<a id="noteref_1880" name="noteref_1880" href="#note_1880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1880</span></span></a> He even tried to stir up Greece to armed
revolt. His fame and power among the Cynic brotherhood
were at their height, or perhaps beginning to wane, when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he conceived the idea of electrifying the world and giving a
demonstration of the triumph of philosophy even over death
by a self-immolation at Olympia. There, before the eyes of
men gathered from all quarters, like Heracles, the great Cynic
exemplar, on Mount Oeta, he resolved to depart in the blaze
and glory of the funeral pyre kindled by his own hand. And
perhaps some rare lettered Cynic brother set afloat a Sibylline
verse, such as abounded in those days, bidding men prepare to
revere another hero, soon to be enthroned along with Heracles
in the broad Olympus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such a career, ambiguous, perhaps, on the most charitable
construction, attracted the eye of the man who sincerely
believed, under all his persiflage, that both the religion and the
philosophy of the past were worn out, and were now being
merely exploited by coarse adventurers for gain or ambition.
Moreover, the Philoctetes of the Cynic Heracles, his pupil
Theagenes, was attracting great audiences in the Gymnasium
of Trajan at Rome.<a id="noteref_1881" name="noteref_1881" href="#note_1881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1881</span></span></a> The self-martyrdom of their chief
had given a fresh inspiration to the Cynic brotherhood.
Who knows but a legend may gather round his name, altars
may be raised to him, and the ancient glamour of the

crew who profane the name of philosophy, and are an
offence to culture?

There is no mistaking the cold merciless spirit in which
Lucian, by his own avowal, addressed himself to the task of
exposing what he genuinely believed to be a feigned enthusiasm.
Even the lover of Lucian receives a kind of shock from
the occasional tone of almost cruel hardness in his treatment of
the Cynic apostle. When Lucian’s narrative of the youthful
enormities of Peregrinus is analysed, it is perceived that the
accuser is anonymous, and that other names and particulars
are carefully suppressed.<a id="noteref_1882" name="noteref_1882" href="#note_1882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1882</span></span></a> For the gravest charges of youthful
depravity no proof or authority is given; they seem to be the
offspring of that prurient gossip which can assail any character.
They are the charges which were freely bandied about in the
age of Pericles and M. Aurelius, in the age of Erasmus and the
age of Milton. There must have been something at least
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>remarkable and fascinating, although marred by extravagance,<a id="noteref_1883" name="noteref_1883" href="#note_1883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1883</span></span></a>
about the man who became a great leader and prophet among
the Christians of Palestine, and who was almost worshipped
as a god. When he was thrown into jail, their widows and
orphans watched by the gates; his jailers were bribed to admit
some of the brethren to console his solitude; large sums were
collected from the cities of Asia for his support and defence.<a id="noteref_1884" name="noteref_1884" href="#note_1884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1884</span></span></a>
The surrender of his paternal property to his native city, an
act of generosity which had many parallels in that age, is
attributed to no higher motive than the wish to hush up a
rumour that Peregrinus had murdered his father. The charge
apparently rested on nothing more substantial than malignant
gossip.<a id="noteref_1885" name="noteref_1885" href="#note_1885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1885</span></span></a> The migration of Peregrinus from the Christian to
the Cynic brotherhood was not so startling in that age as it
may appear to us. Transitions to and fro were not uncommon
between societies which had the common bond of asceticism
and contempt for the world.<a id="noteref_1886" name="noteref_1886" href="#note_1886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1886</span></span></a> Moreover, Lucian, with all his
delicate genius, had little power of understanding the force
of religious enthusiasm. It is pretty clear that Peregrinus
was not an ordinary Cynic; he had felt the spell of Oriental
and Pythagorean mysticism. His Cynicism was probably
tinctured with a religion of the same type as that of Apollonius
of Tyana.<a id="noteref_1887" name="noteref_1887" href="#note_1887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1887</span></span></a> And it is his failure to appreciate the fervour of
this mystical elation in Peregrinus and his disciples which
misled Lucian, and makes his narrative misleading.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lucian suggests that, when he visited Olympia for the
fourth time, he found that the influence of Peregrinus was
on the wane.<a id="noteref_1888" name="noteref_1888" href="#note_1888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1888</span></span></a> Yet even from Lucian’s own narrative it is
clear that Peregrinus and his doings were attracting almost as
much attention as the games. On Lucian’s arrival, the first thing
he heard was a rumour that the great Cynic had resolved to
die upon a flaming pyre, like the hero who was the mythic
patron of the school. Peregrinus professed that by his
self-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>immolation he was going to teach men, in the most impressive
way, to make light of death. And many a Cynic sermon was
evidently delivered on the subject, the greatest preacher being
Theagenes, for whom Lucian displays a particular aversion.
There were, of course, many sceptics like Lucian himself. And
it is in the mouth of one of these enemies of the sect, in reply
to Theagenes, that Lucian has put the defamatory version of
the life of Peregrinus,<a id="noteref_1889" name="noteref_1889" href="#note_1889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1889</span></span></a> to which we have referred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lucian assumes from the first that the self-martyrdom of
Peregrinus was prompted by mere vulgar love of notoriety.<a id="noteref_1890" name="noteref_1890" href="#note_1890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1890</span></span></a>
Yet it is quite possible that this is an unfair judgment. The
Stoic school, with which the Cynics had such a close affinity,
allowed that, in certain circumstances, suicide might be not
only a permissible, but a meritorious, nay, even a glorious act
of self-liberation.<a id="noteref_1891" name="noteref_1891" href="#note_1891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1891</span></span></a> Seneca had often looked gladly to it as
the ever open door of escape from ignominy or torture. The
brilliant Stoic Euphrates, the darling of Roman society, weary
of age and disease, sought and obtained the permission of
Hadrian to drink the hemlock.<a id="noteref_1892" name="noteref_1892" href="#note_1892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1892</span></span></a> And that emperor himself,
in his last sickness, begged the drug from his physician who
killed himself to escape compliance.<a id="noteref_1893" name="noteref_1893" href="#note_1893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1893</span></span></a> Diogenes had handed
the dagger to his favourite pupil, Antisthenes, when tortured
by disease.<a id="noteref_1894" name="noteref_1894" href="#note_1894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1894</span></span></a> The burden of the Cynic preaching was the
nothingness of the things of sense and contempt for death.
Is it not possible that what Lucian heard from the lips of
Peregrinus himself was true, and that he wished, it may be
with mingled motives, by his own act to show men how to
treat with indifference the last terror of humanity?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the end of Peregrinus was surrounded by superstition
and magnified by grandiose effects is more than probable.
Such things belonged to the spirit of the age. And the calm,
critical good sense of Lucian, which had no sympathy with
these weaknesses, saw nothing in the scene but calculating
imposture. Already oracles were circulating in which
Pere<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>grinus appears as the phœnix, rising unscathed and rejuvenescent
from the pyre, predicting that he is to be a guardian spirit
of the night, that altars will rise in his honour, and that he
will perform miracles of healing. Theagenes blazed abroad a
Sibylline verse which bade men, <span class="tei tei-q">“when the greatest of the
Cynics has come to lofty Olympus, to honour the night-roaming
hero who is enthroned beside Hephaestus and the
princely Hector.”</span><a id="noteref_1895" name="noteref_1895" href="#note_1895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1895</span></span></a> Lucian found himself wedged in a dense
crowd who came to hear the last apology of the Cynic
apostle. Some were applauding, and some denouncing him
as an impostor. Lucian could hear little in the melée. But
now and then, above the roar, he could hear the pale,
tremulous old man tell the surging crowd that, having lived
like Heracles, he must die like Heracles, and mingle with the
ether, <span class="tei tei-q">“bringing a golden life to a golden close.”</span><a id="noteref_1896" name="noteref_1896" href="#note_1896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1896</span></span></a> Lucian
thought his paleness was due to terror at the nearness of his
self-imposed death. It was more probably the result of
ascetic fervour and overstrained excitement. The spectacle
sent Lucian away in a fit of rather cruel laughter.<a id="noteref_1897" name="noteref_1897" href="#note_1897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1897</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The closing scene, which took place two or three miles
from Olympia, was ordered with solemn religious effect. It
evidently impressed even the sceptic’s imagination. A high
pyre had been prepared, with torches and faggots ready. As
the moon rose, the voluntary victim appeared in the garb of
his sect, surrounded by his leading disciples. He then disrobed
himself, flung incense on the flame, and, turning to the
south, cried aloud—<span class="tei tei-q">“Daemons of my father and my mother
graciously receive me.”</span> After these words, he leapt into the
blaze which at once enveloped him, and he was seen no more.<a id="noteref_1898" name="noteref_1898" href="#note_1898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1898</span></span></a>
The Cynic brothers stood long gazing into the pyre in silent
grief, until Lucian aroused their anger by some jeers, not, perhaps,
in the best taste. On his way back to Olympia, he pondered
on the follies of men, and the craving for empty fame.<a id="noteref_1899" name="noteref_1899" href="#note_1899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1899</span></span></a> To
Lucian there was nothing more in the tragic scene than that.
And he amused himself by the way with the creation of a
myth, and watching how it would grow. To some who met
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him on the road, too late for the spectacle, he told how, as
the pyre burst into flame, there was a great earthquake accompanied
by subterranean thunder, and a vulture rose from the
fire, proclaiming in a high human voice, as it winged its way
heavenwards, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have left earth behind, and I go to Olympus.”</span><a id="noteref_1900" name="noteref_1900" href="#note_1900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1900</span></span></a>
The poor fools, on whose credulity Lucian was rather heartlessly
playing, with a shudder of awe fell to questioning him
whether the bird flew to the east or the west. And, on his
return to Olympia, he was rewarded in the way he liked best,
by finding the tale which he had cradled already full grown.
A venerable man, whom he encountered, related that with his
own eyes he had seen the vulture rising from the pyre, and
added that he had just met Peregrinus himself walking in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“seven-voiced cloister,”</span> clothed in white raiment, and with a
chaplet of olive on his head.<a id="noteref_1901" name="noteref_1901" href="#note_1901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1901</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lucian’s picture of the death of Peregrinus, whatever we
may think of its fairness and discernment, is immensely
valuable for many things besides the light which it casts on
Lucian’s attitude to all forms of extravagance and superstition.
In spite of his contempt for them, he himself reveals that the
Cynics were a great popular force. We see also that Cynicism
was, in spite of its generally deistic spirit, sometimes leagued
with real or affected religious sentiment. As to the real
character of Peregrinus, there is reason to believe that Lucian
did not read it aright. The impression which the Cynic made
on Aulus Gellius was very different. When Gellius was at
Athens in his student days, he used often to visit Peregrinus,
who was then living in a little hut in the suburbs, and he found
the Cynic’s discourses profitable and high-toned. In particular,
Peregrinus used to tell his hearers that the chance of apparent
evasion or concealment would never tempt the wise man to sin.
Concealment was really impossible, for, in the words of
Sophocles, <span class="tei tei-q">“Time, the all-seeing, the all-hearing, lays bare all
secrets.”</span> Evidently Peregrinus had other admirers besides the
Cynic brethren who hailed his apotheosis at Olympia.<a id="noteref_1902" name="noteref_1902" href="#note_1902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1902</span></span></a> Who
can draw the line, in such an age, between the fanatic and
the impostor?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The bitterness with which Lucian assails the Cynics
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of his day, while it was justified by the scandalous morals
of a certain number, is also a testimony to the world-wide
influence of the sect. The ranks of these rude field-preachers
would not have attracted so many impostors if the
profession had not commanded great power and influence over
the masses. The older Cynicism, which sprang from the
simpler and more popular aspect of the Socratic teaching, had
long disappeared. Its place was taken by the Stoic system,
which gave a broad and highly elaborated scientific basis to the
doctrine of the freedom and independence of the virtuous will.
The rules of conduct were deduced from a well-articulated theory
of the universe and human nature, and they were expounded
with all the dexterity of a finished dialectic. The later
Stoicism, as we have seen, like the other schools, tended to
neglect theory, in the effort to form the virtuous character—a
tendency which is seen at its height in Musonius and
Epictetus. But, as Stoicism became less scientific, it inclined
to return more and more to the spirit and method of the
older Cynicism. The true, earnest Cynic seems to be almost
the philosophic ideal of Epictetus. Thus it was that, in the
first century after Christ, Cynicism emerged from its long
obscurity to take up the part of a rather one-sided popular
Stoicism. It was really pointed or sensational preaching of a
few great moral truths, common to all the schools, which the
condition of society urgently called for.<a id="noteref_1903" name="noteref_1903" href="#note_1903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1903</span></span></a>

man.<a id="noteref_1912" name="noteref_1912" href="#note_1912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1912</span></span></a> Possessing in himself the secret of happiness and woe,
he never descends into the vulgar contest, where he may be
overcome by the vilest and poorest spirits, for objects which
he has trained himself to regard as absolutely indifferent or
worthless. And so, he is proof against the spitefulness of
fortune and the baseness or violence of man. He will calmly
suffer blows or insults as sent by Zeus, just as Heracles bore
cheerfully and triumphantly the toils which were laid on him
by Eurystheus. The true Cynic will even love those who
buffet and insult him.<a id="noteref_1913" name="noteref_1913" href="#note_1913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1913</span></span></a> He will also resemble his patron hero
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the fresh comely strength of his body, which is the gift of

all, he will have a conscience clearer than the sun, so that, at
peace with himself and having assurance of the friendship of the
gods, he may be able to speak with all boldness to his brothers
and his children.<a id="noteref_1915" name="noteref_1915" href="#note_1915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1915</span></span></a> This was the kind of moral ministry which
was needed by the age, and, in spite of both undeserved calumny,
and the real shame of many corrupt impostors in its ranks, the
missionary movement of Cynicism was one of undoubted power
and range. The resemblance, in many points, of the Cynics to
the early Christian monks and ascetics has been often noticed,
and men sometimes passed from the one camp to the other
without any violent wrench.<a id="noteref_1916" name="noteref_1916" href="#note_1916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1916</span></span></a> The rhetor Aristides, in a
fierce attack on the Cynic sect, makes it a reproach that they
have much in common with <span class="tei tei-q">“the impious in Palestine.”</span> Tatian,
and others of the Gnostic ascetics, were in close connection
with leading Cynics.<a id="noteref_1917" name="noteref_1917" href="#note_1917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1917</span></span></a> How easily they were absorbed into
the bosom of the Church we can see from the tale of
Maximus, an Egyptian Cynic of the fourth century, who
continued to wear the distinctive marks of the philosophic
brotherhood, till he was installed as bishop of Constantinople.<a id="noteref_1918" name="noteref_1918" href="#note_1918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1918</span></span></a>
And the contemporary eulogies of Cynic virtue by John
Chrysostom and Themistius testify at once to the importance of
a movement the strength of which was not spent till after the
fall of the Western Empire, and to its affinities for the kindred
movement of Christian asceticism.

was a man of real power and distinction. He was revered by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Seneca as a moral teacher of remarkable influence, <span class="tei tei-q">“a great man

severest counsels which he addressed to others. He would bear
cold and nakedness and hard lodging with cheerful fortitude,
he was a man whom not even the age of Nero could corrupt.
His poverty was genuine, and he would never beg.<a id="noteref_1923" name="noteref_1923" href="#note_1923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1923</span></span></a> He

Yet he had the brand of culture, and once, when his taste was
offended by a bad, tactless reader, who was ruining a passage
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bacchae</span></span>, he snatched the book from his hands and tore
it in pieces.<a id="noteref_1925" name="noteref_1925" href="#note_1925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1925</span></span></a> Although he disdained the trimmed, artificial

that roaming hierophant of philosophy, Apollonius of Tyana,
the bond between them being probably a common asceticism

if not a revolutionary, was a leader of the philosophic opposition,
which assailed the emperors, not so much in their political
capacity, as because they too often represented and stimulated
the moral lawlessness and materialism of the age. Our
sympathies must be with Demetrius when he boldly faced the
dangerous scowl of Nero with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mot</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“You threaten me with

quiet contempt.<a id="noteref_1930" name="noteref_1930" href="#note_1930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1930</span></span></a> In truth, the Flavian emperors, till the expulsion

the whole indulgent to the outspoken freedom of the Cynics.<a id="noteref_1931" name="noteref_1931" href="#note_1931"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1931</span></span></a>
Occasionally, however, the daring censor had, in the interests of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>authority, to be restrained. Once, when Titus was in the
theatre, with the Jewess Berenice by his side, a Cynic, bearing
the name of the founder of the sect, gave voice in a long
bitter oration to popular feeling against what was regarded as
a shameful union. This Cynic John the Baptist, got off with
a scourging.<a id="noteref_1932" name="noteref_1932" href="#note_1932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1932</span></span></a> A comrade named Heros, however, repeated the
offensive expostulation, and lost his head. Peregrinus, for a
similar attack on Antoninus Pius, was quietly warned by the
prefect to leave the precincts of Rome. In the third century
there was a great change in the political fortunes and attitude
of the sect; Cynics are even found basking in imperial
favour, and lending their support to the imperial power.<a id="noteref_1933" name="noteref_1933" href="#note_1933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1933</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Cynics, from the days of Antisthenes, had poured
contempt on the popular religion and the worship of material
images of the Divine. They were probably the purest
monotheists that classical antiquity produced.<a id="noteref_1934" name="noteref_1934" href="#note_1934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1934</span></span></a> Demetrius
is almost Epicurean in his belief in eternal Fate, and his contempt
for the wavering wills and caprices which mythological
fancy ascribed to the Olympian gods.<a id="noteref_1935" name="noteref_1935" href="#note_1935"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1935</span></span></a> Demonax, the
mildest and most humane member of the school in imperial
times, refused to offer sacrifices or even to seek initiation
in the Mysteries of Eleusis.<a id="noteref_1936" name="noteref_1936" href="#note_1936"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1936</span></span></a> When he was impeached for
impiety before the Athenian courts, he replied that, as for
sacrifices, the Deity had no need of them, and that touching
the Mysteries, he was in this dilemma: if they contained
a revelation of what was good for men, he must in duty
publish it; if they were bad and worthless, he would feel
equally bound to warn the people against the deception.
But the most fearless and trenchant assailant of the popular
theology among the Cynics was Oenomaus of Gadara, in the
reign of Hadrian.<a id="noteref_1937" name="noteref_1937" href="#note_1937"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1937</span></span></a> Oenomaus rejected, with the frankest scorn,
the anthropomorphic fables of heathenism. In particular, he
directed his fiercest attacks against the revival of that faith
in oracles and divination which was a marked characteristic
of the Antonine age. Plutarch, in a charming walk
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>round the sights of Delphi, in which he acts as cicerone,
describes a Cynic named Didymus as assailing the influence
of oracles on human character.<a id="noteref_1938" name="noteref_1938" href="#note_1938"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1938</span></span></a> But Oenomaus, as we know
him from Eusebius, was a far more formidable and more
pitiless iconoclast than Didymus. He constructed an elaborate
historical demonstration to show that the oracles were inspired
neither by the gods nor by daemons, but were a very human
contrivance to dupe the credulous. And in connection with
the subject of oracles, he dealt with the question of free-will,
and asserted man’s inalienable liberty, and the responsibility
for all his actions which is the necessary concomitant of
freedom. Oenomaus treated Dodona and Delphi with such
jaunty disrespect that, at the distance of a century and a
half, his memory aroused the anger of Julian to such a degree,
that the imperial champion of paganism could hardly find
words strong enough to express his feelings.<a id="noteref_1939" name="noteref_1939" href="#note_1939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1939</span></span></a> Oenomaus is
a wretch who is cutting at the roots, not only of all reverence
for divine things, but of all those moral instincts implanted
in our souls by God, which are the foundation of all right
conduct and justice. For such fellows no punishment could
be too severe; they are worse than brigands and wreckers.<a id="noteref_1940" name="noteref_1940" href="#note_1940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1940</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The resolute rejection of the forms of popular worship, and
of the claims of divination, is hardly less marked in the mild

But he had conceived from childhood a passion for the philosophic
life, according to the ideal of that age. His teachers
were Cynics or Stoics, but in speculative opinion he was
broadly Eclectic. In his long life he had associated with Demetrius
and Epictetus, Apollonius and Herodes Atticus.<a id="noteref_1944" name="noteref_1944" href="#note_1944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1944</span></span></a> When
asked once who was his favourite philosopher, he replied that
he reverenced Socrates, admired Diogenes, and loved Aristippus.<a id="noteref_1945" name="noteref_1945" href="#note_1945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1945</span></span></a>
His tone had perhaps the greatest affinity for the simplicity of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Socratic teaching. But he did not adopt the irony of the
master, which, if it was a potent arm of dialectic, often left the
subject of it in an irritated and humiliated mood. Demonax
was a true Cynic in his contempt for ordinary objects of greed
and ambition,<a id="noteref_1946" name="noteref_1946" href="#note_1946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1946</span></span></a> in the simple, austere fashion of his daily life,
and in the keen epigrammatic point, often, to our taste, verging
on rudeness, with which he would expose pretence and rebuke
any kind of extravagance.<a id="noteref_1947" name="noteref_1947" href="#note_1947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1947</span></span></a> But although he cultivated a
severe bodily discipline, so as to limit to the utmost his external
wants, he carefully avoided any ostentatious singularity of
manner to win a vulgar notoriety. He had an infinite charity
for all sorts of men, excepting only those who seemed beyond
the hope of amendment.<a id="noteref_1948" name="noteref_1948" href="#note_1948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1948</span></span></a> His counsels were given with an Attic
grace and brightness which sent people away from his company
cheered and improved, and hopeful for the future. Treating
error as a disease incident to human nature, he attacked the
sin, but was gentle to the sinner.<a id="noteref_1949" name="noteref_1949" href="#note_1949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1949</span></span></a> He made it his task to
compose the feuds of cities and to stimulate unselfish patriotism;
he reconciled the quarrels of kinsmen; he would, on occasion,
chasten the prosperous, and comfort the failing and unfortunate,
by reminding both alike of the brief span allotted to either joy
or sorrow, and the long repose of oblivion which would soon set
a term to all the agitations of sorrow or of joy.<a id="noteref_1950" name="noteref_1950" href="#note_1950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1950</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there was another side to his teaching. Demonax was
no supple, easy-going conformist to usages which his reason
rejected. Early in his career, as has been said, he had to face
a prosecution before the tribunals of Athens, because he was
never seen to sacrifice to the gods, and declined initiation at
Eleusis. In each case, he defended his nonconformity in the
boldest tone.<a id="noteref_1951" name="noteref_1951" href="#note_1951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1951</span></span></a> To a prophet whom he saw plying his trade

When asked if he believed the soul to be immortal, he answered,
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is as immortal as everything else.”</span><a id="noteref_1953" name="noteref_1953" href="#note_1953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1953</span></span></a> He derided, in almost

met it. When a youthful Eclectic professed his readiness to
obey any philosophic call, from the Academy, the Porch, or
the Pythagorean discipline of silence, Demonax cried out,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pythagoras calls you.”</span><a id="noteref_1955" name="noteref_1955" href="#note_1955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1955</span></span></a> He rebuked the pedantic archaism

Athenians, from a vulgar jealousy of Corinth, proposed to
defile their ancient memories by establishing gladiatorial shows
under the shadow of the Acropolis. Demonax, in the true spirit

away the altar of Pity.<a id="noteref_1958" name="noteref_1958" href="#note_1958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1958</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Demonax lived to nearly a hundred years. He is said
never to have had an enemy. He was the object of universal
deference whenever he appeared in public. In his old age he
might enter any Athenian house uninvited, and they welcomed
him as their good genius. The children brought him their
little presents of fruit and called him father, and as he passed
through the market, the baker-women contended for the
honour of giving him their loaves. He died a voluntary
death, and wished for no tomb save what nature would give
him. But the Athenians were aware that they had seen in
him a rare apparition of goodness; they honoured him with
a splendid and imposing burial and mourned long for him.
And the bench on which he used to sit when he was weary
they deemed a sacred stone, and decked it with garlands long
after his death.<a id="noteref_1959" name="noteref_1959" href="#note_1959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1959</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Demonax, by a strange personal charm, attained to an
extraordinary popularity and reverence. But the great mass
of philosophic preachers had to face a great deal of obloquy
and vulgar contempt. Apart from the coarseness, arrogance,
and inconsistency of many of them, which gave just offence,
their very profession was an irritating challenge to a pleasure-loving
and worldly age. Men who gloried in the splendour
of their civic life, and were completely absorbed in it, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were flattered and cajoled by their magistrates and popular
leaders, could hardly like to be told by the vagrant, homeless
teacher, in beggar’s garb, that they were ignorant and perverted
and lost in a maze of deception. They would hardly
be pleased to hear that their civilisation was an empty show,
without a solid core of character, that their hopes of happiness
from a round of games and festivals, from the splendour of art
in temples and statues, were the merest mirage. The message
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beati pauperes spiritu—Beati qui lugent</span></span>, will never be a
popular one. That was the message to his age of the itinerant
Cynic preacher, and his unkempt beard and ragged cloak and
the fashion of his life made him the mark of cheap and
abundant ridicule. Sometimes the contempt was deserved;
no great movement for the elevation of humanity has been
free from impostors. Yet the severe judgment of the Cynic
missionaries on their age is that of the polished orator, who
had as great a scorn as Lucian for the sensual or mercenary
Cynic, and yet took up the scrip and staff himself, to propagate
the same gospel as the Cynics.<a id="noteref_1960" name="noteref_1960" href="#note_1960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1960</span></span></a>

Dion Chrysostom was certainly not a Cynic in the academic
sense, but he belonged to the same great movement. He

trained in all the arts of rhetoric, and taught and practised
them in the early part of his life. A suspected friendship led
to his banishment in the reign of Domitian, and in his exile,
with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Falsa Legatione</span></span> as his companions,
he wandered over many lands, supporting himself

Hellenic civilisation on the northern shores of the Euxine.<a id="noteref_1963" name="noteref_1963" href="#note_1963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1963</span></span></a>
The news of the death of Domitian reached a camp on the
Danube when Dion was there. The soldiery, faithful to their
emperor, were excited and indignant, but, under the spell of
Dion’s eloquence, they were brought to acquiesce in the
accession of the blameless Nerva. Dion at length returned
to Rome, and rose to high favour at court. Trajan often
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>invited him to his table, and used to take him as companion
in his state carriage, although the honest soldier did not
pretend to appreciate Dion’s rhetoric.<a id="noteref_1964" name="noteref_1964" href="#note_1964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1964</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During his exile, as he tells us, Dion had been converted
to more serious views of life. The triumphs of conventional
declamation before fashionable audiences lost their glamour.
Dion became conscious of a loftier mission to the dim masses
of that far-spreading empire through whose cities and
wildernesses he was wandering.<a id="noteref_1965" name="noteref_1965" href="#note_1965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1965</span></span></a> As to the eyes of Seneca,
men seemed to Dion, amid all their fair, cheerful life, to
be holding out their hands for help. Wherever he went, he
found that, in his beggar’s dress, he was surrounded by crowds
of people eager to hear any word of comfort or counsel
in the doubts and troubles of their lives. They assumed that
the poor wanderer was a philosopher. They plied him with
questions on the great problem, How to live; and the elegant
sophist was thus compelled to find an answer for them and
for himself.<a id="noteref_1966" name="noteref_1966" href="#note_1966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1966</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dion never quite shook off the traditions and tone of the
rhetorical school. The ambition to say things in the most
elegant and attractive style, the love of amplifying, in leisurely
and elaborate development, a commonplace and hackneyed theme
still clings to him. His eighty orations are many of them
rather essays than popular harangues. They range over all sorts
of subjects, literary, mythological, and artistic, political and
social, as well as purely ethical or religious. But, after all, Dion is
unmistakably the preacher of a great moral revival and reform.
He cannot be classed definitely with any particular school of
philosophy. He is the apostle of Greek culture, yet he admires
Diogenes, the founder of the Cynics.<a id="noteref_1967" name="noteref_1967" href="#note_1967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1967</span></span></a> If he had any philosophic
ancestry, he would probably have traced himself to the
Xenophontic Socrates.<a id="noteref_1968" name="noteref_1968" href="#note_1968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1968</span></span></a> But he is really the rhetorical apostle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the few great moral principles which were in the air, the
common stock of Platonist, Stoic, Cynic, even the Epicurean.
Philosophy to him is really a religion, the science of right
living in conformity to the will of the Heavenly Power. But
it is also the practice of right living. No Christian preacher
has probably ever insisted more strongly on the gulf which
separates the commonplace life of the senses from the life
devoted to a moral ideal.<a id="noteref_1969" name="noteref_1969" href="#note_1969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1969</span></span></a> The only philosophy worth the
name is the earnest quest of the path to true nobility and
virtue, in obedience to the good genius, the unerring monitor
within the breast of each of us, in whose counsels lies the
secret of happiness properly so called.<a id="noteref_1970" name="noteref_1970" href="#note_1970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1970</span></span></a> Hence Dion speaks
with the utmost scorn alike of the coarse Cynic impostor, who
disgraces his calling by buffoonery and debauchery,<a id="noteref_1971" name="noteref_1971" href="#note_1971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1971</span></span></a> and the
philosophic exquisite who tickles the ears of a fashionable
audience with delicacies of phrase, but never thinks of trying
to make them better men. He feels a sincere indignation at this
dilettante trifling, in view of a world which is in urgent need
of practical guidance.<a id="noteref_1972" name="noteref_1972" href="#note_1972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1972</span></span></a> For Dion, after all his wanderings
through the Roman world, has no illusions as to its moral
condition. He is almost as great a pessimist as Seneca or
Juvenal. In spite of all its splendour and outward prosperity,
society in the reign of Trajan seemed to Dion to be in a perilous
state. Along with his own conversion came the revelation of
the hopeless bewilderment of men in the search for happiness.
Dimly conscious of their evil plight, they are yet utterly
ignorant of the way to escape from it. They are swept hither
and thither in a vortex of confused passions and longings for
material pleasures.<a id="noteref_1973" name="noteref_1973" href="#note_1973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1973</span></span></a> Material civilisation, without any accompanying
moral discipline, has produced the familiar and inevitable
result, in an ever-increasing appetite for wealth and
enjoyment and showy distinction, which ends in perpetual disillusionment.
Dion warns the people of Tarsus that they are all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sunk in a deep sensual slumber, and living in a world of mere
dreams, in which the reality of things is absolutely inverted.
Their famous river, their stately buildings, their wealth, even
their religious festivals, on which they plume themselves, are
the merest show of happiness.<a id="noteref_1974" name="noteref_1974" href="#note_1974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1974</span></span></a> Its real secret, which lies in
temperance, justice, and true piety, is quite hidden from their
eyes. When that secret is learnt, their buildings may be less
stately, gold and silver will perhaps not be so abundant, there
will be less soft and delicate living, there may be even fewer
costly sacrifices as piety increases; but there will be a clearer
perception of the true values of things, and a chastened
temperance of spirit, which are the only security for the
permanence of society. And the moralist points his audience
to the splendid civilisations of the past that have perished
because they were without a soul. Assyria and Lydia, the
great cities of Magna Graecia which lived in a dream of luxury,
what are they now? And, latest example of all, Macedon,
who pushed her conquests to the gates of India, and came
into possession of the hoarded treasures of the great Eastern
Empires, is gone, and royal Pella, the home of the race, is now
a heap of bricks.<a id="noteref_1975" name="noteref_1975" href="#note_1975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1975</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It needed a courage springing from enthusiasm and conviction
to preach such unpalatable truths to an age which
gloried in its material splendour. Dion is often conscious
of the difficulty of his task; and he exerts all his trained
dexterity to appease opposition, and gain a hearing for his
message.<a id="noteref_1976" name="noteref_1976" href="#note_1976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1976</span></span></a> As regards the reform of character, Dion has no
new message to deliver. His is the old gospel of renunciation
for the sake of freedom, the doctrine of a right estimate of competing
objects of desire and of the true ends of life. Dion, like
nearly all Greek moralists from Socrates downwards, treats moral
error and reform as rather a matter of the intellect than of
emotional impulse. Vice is the condition of a besotted mind,
which has lost the power of seeing things as they really are;<a id="noteref_1977" name="noteref_1977" href="#note_1977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1977</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conversion must be effected, not by appeals to the feelings, but
by clarifying the mental vision. There is but little reference
to religion as a means of reform, although Dion speaks of the
love of God as a support of the virtuous character. As an
experienced moral director, Dion knew well the necessity of
constant iteration of the old truths. Just as the sick man
will violate his doctor’s orders, well knowing that he does so
to his hurt, so the moral patient may long refuse to follow a
principle of life which his reason has accepted.<a id="noteref_1978" name="noteref_1978" href="#note_1978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1978</span></span></a> And so the
preacher, instead of apologising for repeating himself, will regard
it as a duty and a necessity to do so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Dion did not aim at the formation of any cloistered
virtue, concentrated on personal salvation. He has a fine
passage in which he shows that retreat, (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: normal">ἀναχώρησις</span></span>) detachment
of spirit, is quite possible without withdrawing from the
noises of the world.<a id="noteref_1979" name="noteref_1979" href="#note_1979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1979</span></span></a> And he felt himself charged with a
mission to bring the higher principles of conduct into the civic
life of the time. We know from Pliny’s correspondence with
Trajan, that the great cities of Bithynia, and not least Dion’s
birthplace,<a id="noteref_1980" name="noteref_1980" href="#note_1980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1980</span></span></a> were then suffering from unskilful administration
and wasteful finance. Dion completes the picture by showing
us their miserable bickerings and jealousies about the most
trivial things. He denounces the unscrupulous flattery of the
masses by men whose only object was the transient distinction
of municipal office, the passion for place and power, without any
sober wish to serve or elevate the community. He also exposes
the caprice, the lazy selfishness, and the petulant ingratitude of
the crowd.<a id="noteref_1981" name="noteref_1981" href="#note_1981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1981</span></span></a> Dion, it is true, is an idealist, and his ideals of society
are perhaps not much nearer realisation in some of our great cities
than they were then. He often delivered his message to the
most unpromising audiences. Some of his finest conceptions
of social reorganisation were expounded before rude gatherings
on the very verge of civilisation.<a id="noteref_1982" name="noteref_1982" href="#note_1982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1982</span></span></a> Once, in his wanderings, he
found himself under the walls of a half-ruined Greek town,
which had been attacked, the day before, by a horde of Scythian
barbarians. There, on the steps of the temple of Zeus, he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>expounded to an eager throng of mean Greek traders, with
all the worst vices, and only some faded traces of the culture
of their race, the true meaning of city life.<a id="noteref_1983" name="noteref_1983" href="#note_1983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1983</span></span></a> It is a society of
men under the kingship of law, from which all greed, intemperance,
and violence have been banished; a little world which,
in its peaceful order and linked harmonies, should be modelled
on the more majestic order of the great city of the universe,
the city of gods and men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How far from their ideal were the cities of his native land,
Dion saw only too well. The urban life of Asia, as the result
of the Greek conquests, has perhaps never been surpassed in
external splendour and prosperity, and even in a diffusion of
intellectual culture. The palmy days of the glorious spring-time
of Hellenic vigour and genius in Miletus, Phocaea, and
Rhodes, seemed to be reproduced even in inland places, which
for 1500 years have returned to waste.<a id="noteref_1984" name="noteref_1984" href="#note_1984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1984</span></span></a> Agriculture and
trade combined to produce an extraordinary and prosperous
activity. Education was endowed and organised, and literary
culture became almost universal.<a id="noteref_1985" name="noteref_1985" href="#note_1985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1985</span></span></a> Nowhere did the wandering
sophist find more eager audiences, and no part of the Roman
world in that age contributed so great a number of teachers,
physicians, and philosophers. The single province of Bithynia,
within half a century, could boast of such names as Arrian, Dion
Cassius, and Dion Chrysostom himself. But moral and political
improvement did not keep pace with an immense material
and intellectual progress. The life of the cities indeed was very
intense; but, in the absence of the wider interests of the great
days of freedom, they wasted their energies in futile contests
for visionary distinctions and advantages. A continual struggle
was going on for the <span class="tei tei-q">“primacy”</span> of the province, and the name
of metropolis. Ephesus, the real capital, was challenged by
Smyrna, which on its coins describes itself as <span class="tei tei-q">“first in greatness
and beauty.”</span><a id="noteref_1986" name="noteref_1986" href="#note_1986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1986</span></span></a> The feuds between Nicomedia and its near
neighbour Nicaea caused Dion particular anxiety, and his speech
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the people of Nicomedia is the best picture of the evils
which we are describing.<a id="noteref_1987" name="noteref_1987" href="#note_1987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1987</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two cities have much in common. Their families have
intermarried; they are constantly meeting in their markets
and great religious festivals. They are bound together by
innumerable ties of private friendship.<a id="noteref_1988" name="noteref_1988" href="#note_1988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1988</span></span></a> The primacy for which
they contend is the merest figment; there are no material
advantages at stake. Rather, these dissensions give a corrupt
Roman governor, who trades upon them, the power to injure
both the rival claimants.<a id="noteref_1989" name="noteref_1989" href="#note_1989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1989</span></span></a> The same is true of other cities.
Tarsus is engaged in bitter contention with Mallus for a mere
line of sandhills on their frontiers.<a id="noteref_1990" name="noteref_1990" href="#note_1990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1990</span></span></a> Dion’s native Prusa has
an exasperated quarrel with Apamea for no solid reason whatever,
although the two towns are closely linked by nature to
one another, and mutually dependent through their trade and
manufactures. All this miserable and foolish jealousy Dion
exposes with excellent skill and sense; and he employs an
abundant wealth of illustration in painting the happiness which
attends harmony and good-will. It is the law of the universe,
from the tiny gregarious insect whose life is but for a day, to
the eternal procession of the starry spheres. The ant, in the
common industry of the Lilliputian commonwealth, yields to
his brother toiler, or helps him on his way.<a id="noteref_1991" name="noteref_1991" href="#note_1991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1991</span></span></a> The primal
elements of the Cosmos are tempered to a due observance of
their several bounds and laws. The sun himself hides his
splendour each night to give place to the lesser radiance of
the stars. This is rhetoric, of course, but it is rhetoric with a
moral burden. And it is impossible not to admire the lofty
tone of this heathen sophist, preaching the duty of forgiveness,
of mutual love and deference, the blessing of the quiet spirit
<span class="tei tei-q">“which seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh
no evil.”</span><a id="noteref_1992" name="noteref_1992" href="#note_1992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1992</span></span></a> There is a certain pathos in remembering that,
within the very walls where these elevated orations were
delivered, there were shy companies of men and women meeting
in the early dawn to sing hymns to One who, three
generations before in Galilee, had taught a similar gospel of love
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and self-suppression, but with a strange mystic charm, denied
to the pagan eloquence, and that Dion seems never to have
known those with whom he had so close a kindred.<a id="noteref_1993" name="noteref_1993" href="#note_1993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1993</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In many another oration Dion strove to raise the moral
tone of his age. His speech to the Alexandrians is probably
his most gallant protest against the besetting sins of a great
population. Alexandria was a congeries of many races, in
which probably the Hellenic type of the Ptolemies had succumbed
to the enduring Egyptian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">morale</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1994" name="noteref_1994" href="#note_1994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1994</span></span></a> It was a populace at once
sensual and superstitious, passionately devoted to all excitement,
whether of games or orgiastic religious festival, with a
jeering irreverent vein, which did not spare even the greatest
Emperors. It was a curious medley—the seat of the most
renowned university of the ancient world, the gathering-place
and seed-ground of ideas which united the immemorial
mysticism of the East with the clear, cold reason of Hellas—and
yet a seething hot-bed of obscenity, which infected the
Roman world, a mob who gave way to lunatic excitement over
the triumph of an actor, or a singer, or the victor in a chariot-race.<a id="noteref_1995" name="noteref_1995" href="#note_1995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1995</span></span></a>
It required no ordinary courage to address such a crowd,
and to charge them with their glaring faults. The people of
Alexandria are literally intoxicated with a song. The music
which, according to old Greek theory, should regulate the passions,
here only maddens them.<a id="noteref_1996" name="noteref_1996" href="#note_1996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1996</span></span></a> And in the races all human

the Ganges.<a id="noteref_1999" name="noteref_1999" href="#note_1999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1999</span></span></a> They come to witness the shame of the second

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a foil to the feverish life of luxury, quarrelsome rivalry,
and vulgar excitement which prevailed in the great towns,
Dion has left a prose idyll to idealise the simple pleasures and
virtues of the country.<a id="noteref_2000" name="noteref_2000" href="#note_2000"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2000</span></span></a> It is also a dirge over the decay

of his vessel on the dreaded Hollows of Euboea, was sheltered, in
a rude, warm-hearted fashion, by some peasants. Their fathers
had been turned adrift in the confiscation of the estate of a
great noble in some trouble with the emperor, and they had
made themselves a lonely home on a pastoral slope, close to a
stream, with the neighbouring shade of trees. They had taken
into tillage a few fields around their huts; they drove their
cattle to the high mountain pastures in summer time, and in
the winter they turned to hunting the game along the snowy
tracks. Of city life they know hardly anything. One of them,
indeed, had been twice in the neighbouring town, and he tells
what he saw there in a lively way. It is all a mere shadow
or caricature of the old civic life of Greece. There are the
rival orators, patriot or demagogue, the frivolous and capricious
crowd, the vote of the privilege of dining in the town-hall. The
serious purpose of the piece, however, is to idealise the simple
virtue and happiness of the country folk, and to discuss the
disheartening problem of the poor in great cities.<a id="noteref_2002" name="noteref_2002" href="#note_2002"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2002</span></span></a> It is in
the main the problem of our modern urban life, and Dion had
evidently thought deeply about it, and was an acute observer
of the social misery which is the same from age to age.
Fortified by the divine Homer and ordinary experience, he
points out that the poor are more generous and helpful to the
needy than are the rich out of their ample store. Too often
the seeming bounty of the wealthy benefactor is of the nature
of a loan, which is to be returned with due interest.<a id="noteref_2003" name="noteref_2003" href="#note_2003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2003</span></span></a> The

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>discussion of the perpetual problem of prostitution, which
probably no ancient writer ever faced so boldly. The double
degradation of humanity, which it involved in the ancient world,
is powerfully painted;<a id="noteref_2004" name="noteref_2004" href="#note_2004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2004</span></span></a> and the plea that the indulgence in venal

shown in Dion’s treatment of slavery. He sees its fell effects
on the masters, in producing sensuality, languor, and helpless
dependence on others for the slightest services. He points
out that there is no criterion afforded by nature to distinguish
slave and free. The so-called free man of the highest rank
may be the offspring of a servile amour, and the so-called slave
may be ingenuous in every sense, condemned to bondage by an
accident of fortune.<a id="noteref_2006" name="noteref_2006" href="#note_2006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2006</span></span></a> Just as external freedom does not imply
moral worth, so legal enslavement does not imply moral degradation.<a id="noteref_2007" name="noteref_2007" href="#note_2007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2007</span></span></a>

in society by their deserts, master and slave would often have
to change places.<a id="noteref_2008" name="noteref_2008" href="#note_2008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2008</span></span></a> In Dion’s judgment as to the enervating
effects of slavery on the slave-owning class, and the absence of
any moral or mental distinction to justify the institution, he
is in singular harmony with Seneca.

The similarity of tone between Seneca and Dion is perhaps
even more marked in their treatment of monarchy. Inherited,
like so much else, from the great Greek thinkers of the fifth
and fourth centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, the ideal of a beneficent and unselfish
prince, the true <span class="tei tei-q">“shepherd of the people,”</span> the antithesis of
the lawless and sensual tyrant, had become, partly, no
doubt, through the influence of the schools of rhetoric, a
common possession of cultivated minds. Vespasian gave it
a certain reality, if his son Domitian showed how easily the
king might pass into the tyrant. The dream of an earthly
providence, presiding over the Roman world, dawned in more
durable splendour with the accession of Trajan, and Pliny,
his panegyrist, has left us a sketch of the patriot prince,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which is almost identical with the lines of Dion’s ideal.<a id="noteref_2009" name="noteref_2009" href="#note_2009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2009</span></span></a>
Both Dion and Pliny were favourites of Trajan, and some of
Dion’s orations were delivered before his court. As a court
preacher, he justly boasts that he is no mere flatterer, although
we may suspect that his picture of the ideal monarch might
have been interpreted as drawn from the character of Trajan,
just as his picture of the tyrant was probably suggested by
Domitian.<a id="noteref_2010" name="noteref_2010" href="#note_2010"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2010</span></span></a> Still, we may well believe the orator when he
says that the man who had bearded the one at the cost of
long exile and penury, was not likely to flatter the other for
the gold or honours which he despised. And in these
discourses, Dion seems full of the sense of a divine mission.
Once, on his wanderings, he lost his way somewhere on the
boundaries of Arcadia, and, ascending a knoll to recover the
track, he found himself before a rude, ruined shrine of
Heracles, hung with votive offerings of the chase.<a id="noteref_2011" name="noteref_2011" href="#note_2011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2011</span></span></a> An aged
woman sat by them who told him that she had a spirit of
divination from the gods. The shepherds and peasants used
to come to her with questions about the fate of their flocks
and crops. And she now entrusted Dion with a message to
the great ruler of many men whom she prophesied Dion was
soon to meet.<a id="noteref_2012" name="noteref_2012" href="#note_2012"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2012</span></span></a> It was a tale of Heracles, the great benefactor
of men from the rising to the setting sun, who, by his simple
strength, crushed all lawless monsters and gave the world
an ordered peace. His father inspired him with noble
impulse for his task by oracle and omen, and sent Hermes
once, when Heracles was still a boy at Thebes, to show him
the vision of the Two Peaks, and strengthen him in his virtue.<a id="noteref_2013" name="noteref_2013" href="#note_2013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2013</span></span></a>
They rose from the same rocky roots, amid precipitous crags
and deep ravines, and the noise of many waters. At first they
seemed to be one mountain mass, but they soon parted wide
asunder, the one being sacred to Zeus, the other to the lawless
Typhon. On the one crest, rising into the cloudless ether,
Kingship sits enthroned, in the likeness of a fair, stately
woman, clad in robes of glistening white, and wielding a
sceptre of brighter and purer metal than any silver or gold.
Under her steady gaze of radiant dignity, the good felt a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cheerful confidence, the bad quailed and shrank away. She
was surrounded by handmaidens of a beauty like her own,
Justice and Peace and Order. The paths to the other peak
were many and secret, and skirted an abyss, streaming with
blood or choked with corpses. Its top was wrapped in mist
and cloud, and there sat Tyranny on a far higher and more
pompous throne, adorned with gold and ivory and many a
gorgeous colour, but a throne rocking and unstable. She
strove to make herself like to Kingship, but it was all mere
hollow pretence. Instead of the gracious smile, there was a
servile, hypocritical leer; instead of the glance of dignity,
there was a savage scowl. And around her sat a throng
bearing ill-omened names, Cruelty and Lust, Lawlessness and
Flattery and Sedition. On a question from Hermes, the
youthful Heracles made his choice, and his father gave him
his commission to be the saviour of men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this fashion Dion, like Aeschylus, recasts old myth to
make it the vehicle of moral instruction, just as he finds in
Homer the true teacher of kings.<a id="noteref_2014" name="noteref_2014" href="#note_2014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2014</span></span></a> The theory of ideal monarchy
is developed at such length as may have somewhat wearied
the emperor. But it really is based on a few great principles.
True kings, in Homer’s phrase, are sons of Zeus, and they are
shepherds of the people. All genuine political power rests on
virtue, and ultimately on the favour of Heaven. A king is
appointed by God to work the good of his subjects. And, as
his authority is divine, an image on earth of the sovereignty of
Zeus, the monarch will be a scrupulously religious man in the
highest sense,<a id="noteref_2015" name="noteref_2015" href="#note_2015"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2015</span></span></a> not merely by offering costly sacrifices, but by
righteousness, diligence, and self-sacrifice in performing the duties
of his solemn charge. The many titles addressed to Father Zeus
represent so many aspects of royal activity and virtue. The
true prince will be the father of his people, surrounded and
guarded by a loving reverence, which never degenerates into
fear. His only aim will be their good. He will keep sleepless
watch over the weak, the careless, those who are heedless for
themselves. Commanding infinite resources, he will know less
of mere pleasure than any man within his realm. With such
immense responsibilities, he will be the most laborious of all.
His only advantage over the private citizen is in his boundless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>command of friendship; for all men must be well-wishers to
one wielding such a beneficent power, with whom, from his
conception of his mission, they must feel an absolute identity
of interest. And the king’s greatest need is friendship, to
provide him with myriads of hands and eyes in the vast work
of government.<a id="noteref_2016" name="noteref_2016" href="#note_2016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2016</span></span></a> Herein lies the sharpest contrast between the
true king and the tyrant, a contrast which was a commonplace
in antiquity, but which was stamped afresh by the juxtaposition
of the reign of Domitian and the reign of Trajan. The universal
hatred which pursued a bad Caesar even beyond the grave,
which erased his name from monuments and closed its eyes
even to intervals of serious purpose for the general weal, was a
terrible illustration of the lonely friendlessness of selfish power.<a id="noteref_2017" name="noteref_2017" href="#note_2017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2017</span></span></a>
Instead of loyal and grateful friendship, the despot was mocked
by a venal flattery which was only its mimicry. The good
monarch will treat flatterers as false coiners who cause the
genuine currency to be suspected. This counsel and others of
Dion were often little regarded by succeeding emperors. Yet
even the last shadowy princes of the fifth century professed
themselves the guardians of the human race, and are oppressed
by an ideal of universal beneficence which they are impotent
to realise.<a id="noteref_2018" name="noteref_2018" href="#note_2018"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2018</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hitherto we have been occupied with the preaching of
Dion on personal conduct, the reform of civic life, or the
duties of imperial power. It cannot be said that he discusses
these subjects without reference to religious beliefs and
aspirations.<a id="noteref_2019" name="noteref_2019" href="#note_2019"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2019</span></span></a> But religion is rather in the background; the
reverence for the Heavenly Powers is rather assumed as a
necessary basis for human life rightly ordered. There is one
oration, however, of supreme interest to the modern mind, in
which Dion goes to the root of all religion, and examines the
sources of belief in God and the justification of anthropomorphic
imagery in representing Him. This utterance was
called forth by a visit to Olympia when Dion was advanced
in years.<a id="noteref_2020" name="noteref_2020" href="#note_2020"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2020</span></span></a> The games of Olympia were a dazzling and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>inspiring spectacle, and the multitude which gathered there
from all parts of the world was a splendid audience. But,
with the sound of the sacred trumpet, and the herald’s voice,
proclaiming the victor, in his ears, Dion turns away from all
the glory of youthful strength and grace, even from the
legendary splendour of the great festival,<a id="noteref_2021" name="noteref_2021" href="#note_2021"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2021</span></span></a> to the majestic
figure of the Olympian Zeus, which had been graved by the
hand of Pheidias more than 500 years before, and to the
thoughts of the divine world which it suggested. That
greatest triumph of idealism in plastic art, inspired by
famous lines in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span>, was, by the consent of all antiquity,
the masterpiece of Pheidias. Ancient writers of many ages
are lost in admiration of the mingled majesty and benignity
which the divine effigy expressed. To the eyes of Lucian it
seemed <span class="tei tei-q">“the very son of Kronos brought down to earth, and
set to watch over the lonely plain of Elis.”</span><a id="noteref_2022" name="noteref_2022" href="#note_2022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2022</span></span></a> There it sat
watching for more than 800 years, till it was swept away in
the fierce, final effort to dethrone the religion of the past.
Yet the majestic image, which attracted the fury of the
iconoclasts of the reign of Theodosius, inspired Dion with
thoughts of the Divine nature which travelled far beyond the
paganism either of poetry or of the crowd. It was not merely
the masterpiece of artistic and constructive skill which had
fascinated the gaze, and borne the vicissitudes, of so many
centuries, that moved his admiration; it was also, and more,
the moral effect of that miracle of art on the spectator. The
wildest and fiercest of the brute creation might be calmed and
softened by the air of majestic peace and kindness which
floated around the gold and ivory. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever among
mortal men is most utterly toil-worn in spirit, having drunk
the cup of many sorrows and calamities, when he stands before
this image, methinks, must utterly forget all the terrors and
woes of this mortal life.”</span><a id="noteref_2023" name="noteref_2023" href="#note_2023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2023</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the thoughts of Dion, in presence of the majestic
figure at Olympia, take a wider range. His theme is nothing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>less than the sources of our idea of God, and the place of art in
religion. He pours his scorn upon hedonistic atheism. Our
conception of God is innate, original, universal among all the
races of men.<a id="noteref_2024" name="noteref_2024" href="#note_2024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2024</span></span></a> It is the product of the higher reason, contemplating
the majestic order, minute adaptation, and beneficent
provision for human wants in the natural world. In
that great temple, with its alternations of gloom and splendour,
its many voices of joy or of terror, man is being perpetually
initiated in the Great Mysteries, on a grander scale than at
Eleusis, with God Himself to preside over the rites. The
belief in God depends in the first instance on no human
teaching, any more than does the love of child to parent.
But this original intuition and belief in divine powers finds
expression through the genius of inspired poets; it is reinforced
by the imperative prescriptions of the founders and lawgivers
of states; it takes external form in bronze or gold and ivory
or marble, under the cunning hand of the great artist; it is
developed and expounded by philosophy.<a id="noteref_2025" name="noteref_2025" href="#note_2025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2025</span></span></a> Like all the
deepest thinkers of his time, Dion is persuaded of the certainty
of God’s existence, but he is equally conscious of the remoteness
of the Infinite Spirit, and of the weakness of all human
effort to approach, or to picture it to the mind of man. We
are to Dion like <span class="tei tei-q">“children crying in the night, and with no
language but a cry.”</span><a id="noteref_2026" name="noteref_2026" href="#note_2026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2026</span></span></a> Yet the child will strive to image
forth the face of the Father, although it is hidden behind a
veil which will never be withdrawn in this world. The
genius of poetry, commanding the most versatile power of
giving utterance to the religious imagination, is first in order
and in power. Law and institution follow in its wake. The
plastic arts, under cramping limitations, come later still to
body forth the divine dreams of the elder bards. Dion had
thought much on the relative power of poetry and the
sculptor’s art to give expression to the thoughts and feelings
of man about the Divine nature. The boundless power or
licence of language to find a symbol for every thought or
image on the phantasy is seen at its height in Homer, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>riots in an almost lawless exercise of his gifts.<a id="noteref_2027" name="noteref_2027" href="#note_2027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2027</span></span></a> But the chief
importance of the discussion lies in an arraignment of Pheidias
for attempting to image in visible form the great Soul and
Ruler of the universe, Whom mortal eye has never seen and
can never see. His defence is very interesting, both as a
clear statement of the limitations of the plastic arts, and as a
justification of material images of the Divine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pheidias pleads in his defence that the artist could not, if
he would, desert the ancient religious tradition, which was
consecrated in popular imagination by the romance of poetry;<a id="noteref_2028" name="noteref_2028" href="#note_2028"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2028</span></span></a>
that is fixed for ever. Granted that the Divine nature is far
removed from us, and far beyond our ken; yet, as little
children separated from their parents, feel a strong yearning
for them and stretch out their hands vainly in their dreams,
so the race of man, from love and kindred, longs ever to draw
nigh to the unseen God by prayer and sacrifice and visible
symbol. The ruder races will image their god in trees or shapeless
stones, or may seek a strange symbol in some of the lower
forms of animal life.<a id="noteref_2029" name="noteref_2029" href="#note_2029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2029</span></span></a> The higher may find sublime expression
of His essence in the sun and starry spheres. For the pure
and infinite mind which has engendered and which sustains the
universe of life, no sculptor or painter of Hellas has ever found,
or can ever find, full and adequate expression.<a id="noteref_2030" name="noteref_2030" href="#note_2030"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2030</span></span></a> Hence men
take refuge in the vehicle and receptacle of the noblest spirit
known to them, the form of man. And the Infinite Spirit, of
which the human is an effluence, may perhaps best be embodied
in the form of His child.<a id="noteref_2031" name="noteref_2031" href="#note_2031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2031</span></span></a> But no effort or ecstasy of artistic
fancy, in form or colour, can ever follow the track of the Homeric
imagination in its majesty and infinite variety of expression.
The sculptor and painter have fixed limits set to their skill,
beyond which they cannot pass. They can appeal only to the
eye; their material has not the infinite ductility and elasticity
of the poetic dialect of many tribes and many generations.
They can seize only a single moment of action or passion, and
fix it for ever in bronze or stone. Yet Pheidias, with a certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>modest self-assertion, pleads that his conception of the Olympian
Zeus, although less various and seductive than Homer’s, although
he cannot present to the gazer the crashing thunderbolt or the
baleful star, or the heaving of Olympus, is perhaps more elevating
and inspiring.<a id="noteref_2032" name="noteref_2032" href="#note_2032"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2032</span></span></a> The Zeus of Pheidias is the peace-loving
and gentle providence of an undisturbed and harmonious
Greece, the august giver of all good gifts, the father and
saviour and guardian of men. The many names by which
men call him may each find some answering trait in the
laborious work of the chisel. In the lines of that majestic
and benign image are shadowed forth the mild king and father,
the hearer of prayer, the guardian of civic order and family
love, the protector of the stranger, and the power who gives
fertile increase to flock and field. The Zeus of Pheidias and
of Dion is a God of mercy and peace, with no memory of the
wars of the Giants.<a id="noteref_2033" name="noteref_2033" href="#note_2033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2033</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dion is a popular teacher of morality, not a thinker or
theologian. But this excursion into the field of theology
shows him at his best. And it prepares us for the study of
some more formal efforts to find a theology in the poetry
of legend.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The times were ripe for a theodicy. Religion of every mood
and tone, of every age and clime, was in the air, and philosophy
had abandoned speculation and turned to the direction of conduct
and spiritual life. The mission of philosophy is to find
the one in the many, and never did the religious life of men
offer a more bewildering multiplicity and variety, not to say
chaos, to the ordering power of philosophy. The scepticism
of the Neronian age had almost disappeared. The only
rationalists of any distinction in the second century were
Lucian and Galen.<a id="noteref_2034" name="noteref_2034" href="#note_2034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2034</span></span></a> It was an age of imperious spiritual
cravings, alike among the cultivated and the vulgar. But
the thin abstractions of the old Latin faith and the brilliant
anthropomorphism of Greece had ceased to satisfy even the
crowd. It was an age with a longing for a religious system
less formal and coldly external, for a religion more satisfying
to the deeper emotions, a religion which should offer divine
help to human need and misery, divine guidance amid the
darkness of time; above all, a divine light in the mystery of
death. The glory of classic art had mysteriously closed. It
was an age rather of material splendour, and, at first sight, an
age of bourgeois ideals of parochial fame and mere enjoyment
of the hour. Yet the Antonine age has some claim to spiritual
distinction. In the dim, sub-conscious feelings of the masses,
as well as in the definite spiritual effort of the higher minds,
there was really a great movement towards a ruling principle
of conduct and a spiritual vision. Men often, indeed, followed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the marsh-light through strange devious paths into wildernesses
peopled with the spectres of old-world superstition. But the
light of the Holy Grail had at last flashed on the eyes of some
loftier minds. From the early years of the second century we
can trace that great combined movement of the new Platonism
and the revived paganism,<a id="noteref_2035" name="noteref_2035" href="#note_2035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2035</span></span></a> which so long retarded the triumph
of the Church, and yet, in the Divinely-guided evolution, was
destined to prepare men for it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old religion had not lost all hold on men’s minds, as it is
sometimes said to have done, in rather too sweeping language.
The punctilious ritual with which, in the stately narrative of
Tacitus, the Capitol was restored by Vespasian, the pious care
with which the young Aurelius recited the Salian litany in
words no longer understood, the countless victims which he
offered to the guardian gods of Rome in evil days of pestilence
and doubtful war, these things reveal the strength of the
religion of Numa. Two centuries after M. Aurelius was in his
grave, the deities which had cradled the Roman state, and
watched over its career, were still objects of reverence to the
conservative circle of Symmachus. A religion which was
intertwined with the whole fabric of government and society,
which gave its sanction or benediction to every act and
incident in the individual life, which was omnipresent in game
and festival, in temple and votive monument, was placed far
beyond the influence of changing fashions of devotion. It
was a powerful stay of patriotism, a powerful bond of civic
and family life; it threw a charm of awe and old-world sanctity
around everything it touched. But for the deeper spiritual
wants and emotions it furnished little nutriment. To find
relief and cleansing from the sense of guilt, cheer and glad
exaltation of pious emotion, consolation in the common miseries
of life, and hope in the shadow of death, men had to betake
themselves to other systems. The oriental religions were pouring
in like a flood, and spreading over all the West. One
Antonine built a shrine of Mithra,<a id="noteref_2036" name="noteref_2036" href="#note_2036"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2036</span></span></a> another took the tonsure
of Isis.<a id="noteref_2037" name="noteref_2037" href="#note_2037"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2037</span></span></a> The priests and acolytes of the Egyptian goddess
were everywhere, chanting their litanies in solemn processions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>along the streets, instructing and baptizing their catechumens,
and, in the alternating gloom and splendour of their mysteries,
bearing the entranced soul to the boundaries of life and death.<a id="noteref_2038" name="noteref_2038" href="#note_2038"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2038</span></span></a>
Mithra, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Unconquered,”</span> was justifying his name. In
every district from the Euxine to the Solway he brought a
new message to heathendom. Pure from all grossness of
myth, the Persian god of light came as the mediator and
comforter, to soothe the poor and broken-hearted, and give the
cleansing of the mystic blood. His hierarchy of the initiated,
his soothing symbolic sacraments, his gorgeous ritual, and his
promise of immortality to those who drank the mystic Haoma,
gratified and stimulated religious longings which were to find
their full satisfaction in the ministry of the Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the religious imagination was not satisfied with historic
and accredited systems. Travel and conquest were adding to
the spiritual wealth or burden of the Roman race. In lonely
Alpine passes, in the deserts of Africa, or the Yorkshire dales,
in every ancient wood or secret spring which he passed in his
wanderings or campaigns, the Roman found hosts of new
divinities, possible helpers or possible enemies, whose favour
it was expedient to win.<a id="noteref_2039" name="noteref_2039" href="#note_2039"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2039</span></span></a> And, where he knew not their
strange outlandish names, he would try to propitiate them all
together under no name, or any name that pleased them.<a id="noteref_2040" name="noteref_2040" href="#note_2040"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2040</span></span></a>
And, as if this vague multitude of ghostly powers were not
large enough for devotion, the fecundity of imagination created
a host of genii, of haunting or guarding spirits, attached to
every place or scene, to every group or corporation of men
which had a place in Roman life. There were genii of the

the Roman people, above all, there was the genius of the
emperor.<a id="noteref_2041" name="noteref_2041" href="#note_2041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2041</span></span></a> Apotheosis went on apace—apotheosis not merely
of the emperors, but of a theurgic philosopher like Apollonius,
of a minion like Antinous, of a mere impostor like Alexander

decadent in the reign of Nero, sprang into fresh life and
popularity in the reign of Trajan. New sources of oracular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>inspiration were opened, some of them challenging for the

Lucian, oracles were pealing from every rock and every altar.<a id="noteref_2044" name="noteref_2044" href="#note_2044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2044</span></span></a>
Every form of revelation or divination, every avenue of access
to the Divine, was eagerly sought for, or welcomed with pious
credulity. The study of omens and dreams was reduced to the
form of a pseudo-science by a host of writers like Artemidorus.
The sacred art of healing through visions of the night found a
home in those charming temples of Asclepius, which rose
beside so many hallowed springs, with fair prospect and genial
air, where the god revealed his remedy in dreams, and a lore
half hieratic, half medical, was applied to relieve the sufferer.<a id="noteref_2045" name="noteref_2045" href="#note_2045"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2045</span></span></a>
Miracles and special providences, the most marvellous or the
most grotesque, were chronicled with unquestioning faith, not
only by fanatics like Aelian, but by learned historians like
Tacitus and Suetonius. Tales of witchcraft and weird sorcery
are as eagerly believed at Trimalchio’s dinner-table<a id="noteref_2046" name="noteref_2046" href="#note_2046"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2046</span></span></a> as in
lonely villages of Thessaly. On the higher level of the new
Pythagorean faith, everything is possible to the pure spirit.
To such a soul God will reveal Himself by many voices to
which gross human clay is deaf; the future lays bare its secrets;
nature yields up her hidden powers. Spiritual detachment
triumphs over matter and time; and the Pythagorean apostle
predicts a plague at Ephesus, casts out demons, raises the
dead, vanishes like a phantom from the clutches of Domitian.<a id="noteref_2047" name="noteref_2047" href="#note_2047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2047</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At a superficial glance, a state of religion such as has been
sketched might seem to be a mere bewildering chaos of infinitely
divided spiritual interest. Men seem to have adopted the
mythologies of every race, and to have superadded a new
mythology of positively boundless fecundity. A single votive
tablet will contain the names of the great gods of Latium and
Greece, of Persia, Commagene, and Egypt, and beside them,
strange names of British or Swiss, Celtic, Spanish, or Moorish
gods, and the vaguely-designated spirits who now seemed
to float in myriads around the scenes of human life.<a id="noteref_2048" name="noteref_2048" href="#note_2048"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2048</span></span></a> Yet,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unperceived by the ordinary devotee, amid all this confused
ferment, a certain principle of unity or comprehension was
asserting its power. Although the old gods in Lucian’s piece
might comically complain that they were being crowded out
of Olympus by Mithra and Anubis and their barbarous company,<a id="noteref_2049" name="noteref_2049" href="#note_2049"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2049</span></span></a>
there was really little jealousy or repulsion among the
pagan cults. Ancient ritual was losing its precision of outline;
the venerable deities of classical myth were putting off
the decided individuality which had so long distinguished them
in the popular imagination.<a id="noteref_2050" name="noteref_2050" href="#note_2050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2050</span></span></a> The provinces and attributes
of kindred deities melted into one another and were finally
identified; syncretism was in the air. Without the unifying
aid of philosophy, ordinary piety was effecting unconsciously
a vast process of simplification which tended to ideal unity.
In the Sacred Orations of Aristides, Poseidon, Athene, Serapis,
Asclepius, are dropping the peculiar powers by which they
were so long known, and rising, without any danger of collision,
to all-embracing sway. So, the Isis of Apuleius, the <span class="tei tei-q">“goddess
of myriad names,”</span> in her vision to Lucius, boldly claims
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen of the world of shades, first of the inhabitants
of Heaven, in whom all gods find their unchanging type.”</span><a id="noteref_2051" name="noteref_2051" href="#note_2051"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2051</span></span></a>
Of course, to the very end, the common superstitious devotion
of the masses was probably little influenced by the great
spiritual movement which, in the higher strata, was moulding
heathen faith into an approach to monotheism. The simple
peasant still clung to his favourite deity, as his Catholic
descendant has to-day his favourite saint. But it is in the
higher minds that the onward sweep of great spiritual movements
can really be discerned. The initiation of Apuleius in
all the mysteries, the reverent visits of Apollonius to every
temple and oracle from the Ganges to the Guadalquivir, the
matins of Alexander Severus in a chapel which enshrined the
images of Abraham and Orpheus, of Apollonius and Christ;<a id="noteref_2052" name="noteref_2052" href="#note_2052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2052</span></span></a>
these, and many other instances of all-embracing devotion,
point forward to the goal of that Platonist théodicée which it
is the purpose of this chapter to expound.

The spectacle of an immense efflorescence of pure paganism,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>most of it born of very mundane fears and hopes and desires,
to men like Lucian was a sight which might, according to the
mood, move to tears or laughter. But the same great impulse
which drove the multitude into such wild curiosity of superstition,
was awaking loftier conceptions of the Divine, and
feelings of purer devotion in the educated. And sometimes
the very highest and the very lowest developments of the
protean religious instinct may be seen in a single mind. Was
there ever such a combination of the sensualist imagination
with the ideal of ascetic purity, of the terrors and dark arts
of anile superstition with the mystic vision of God, as in the
soul of Apuleius? The painter of the foulest scenes in ancient
literature seems to have cherished the faith in a heavenly King,
First Cause of all nature, Father of all living things,<a id="noteref_2053" name="noteref_2053" href="#note_2053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2053</span></span></a> Saviour of
spirits, beyond the range of time and change, remote, ineffable.
The prayer of thanksgiving to Isis might, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis mutandis</span></span>, be
almost offered in a Christian church. The conception of the
unity and purity of the Divine One was the priceless conquest
of Greek philosophy, and pre-eminently of Plato. It had
been brought home to the Roman world by the teaching of
Stoicism. But there is a new note in the monotheism of
the first and second centuries of the Empire. God is no
longer a mere intellectual postulate, the necessary crown
and lord of a great cosmic system. He has become a moral
necessity. His existence is demanded by the heart as well as
by the intellect. Men craved no longer for a God to explain
the universe, but to resolve the enigma of their own lives; not
a blind force, moving on majestically and mercilessly to <span class="tei tei-q">“some
far-off event,”</span> but an Infinite Father guiding in wisdom,
cherishing in mercy, and finally receiving His children to
Himself. This is the conception of God which, from Seneca
to M. Aurelius, is mastering the best minds, both Stoic and
Platonist.<a id="noteref_2054" name="noteref_2054" href="#note_2054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2054</span></span></a> Seneca, as we have seen in a former chapter, often
speaks in the hard tones of the older Stoicism. Sometimes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>God, Nature, Fate, Jupiter, are identical terms<a id="noteref_2055" name="noteref_2055" href="#note_2055"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2055</span></span></a>. But the
cold, materialistic conception of God is irreconcilable with
many passages in his writings. Like Epictetus and M. Aurelius,
Seneca is often far more emotional, we may say, far more
modern, than his professed creed. The materialistic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anima
Mundi</span></span>, interfused with the universe and the nature of man,
becomes the infinitely benign Creator, Providence, and Guardian,
the Father, and almost the Friend of men. He is the Author
of all good, never of evil: He is gentle and pitiful, and to
attribute to Him storm or pestilence or earthquake or the
various plagues of human life is an impiety. These things are
the result of physical law. To such a God boundless gratitude
is due for His goodness, resignation in the wise chastenings of
His hand. He chastises whom he loves. In bereavement, He
takes only what He has given. He is our ready helper in
every moral effort; no goodness is possible without His succour.
In return for all His benefits, He asks for no costly material
offerings, no blood of victims, no steaming incense, no adulation
in prayer. Faith in God is the true worship of Him. If you
wish to propitiate Him, imitate His goodness. And for the
elect soul the day of death is a birthday of eternity, when the
load of corporeal things is shaken off, and the infinite splendour
of the immortal life spreads out with no troubling shadow.<a id="noteref_2056" name="noteref_2056" href="#note_2056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2056</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hardly less striking is the warmth of devout feeling which
suffuses the moral teaching of Epictetus and M. Aurelius.
They have not indeed abandoned the old Stoic principle that
man’s final good depends on the rectitude of the will. But
the Stoic sage is no longer a solitary athlete, conquering by
his proud unaided strength, and in his victory rising almost
superior to Zeus. Growing moral experience had taught
humility, and inspired the sense of dependence on a Higher
Power in sympathy with man.<a id="noteref_2057" name="noteref_2057" href="#note_2057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2057</span></span></a> No true Stoic, of course,
could ever forget the Divine element within each human soul
which linked it with the cosmic soul, and through which man
might bring himself into harmony with the great polity of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gods and men. But, somehow, the Divine Power immanent in
the world, from a dim, cold, impalpable law or fate or impersonal
force, slowly rounds itself off into a Being, if not
apart from man, at any rate his superior, his Creator and
Guardian, nay, in the end, his Father, from whom he comes,
to whom he returns at death. Some may think this a decline
from the lofty plane of the older school. The answer is that the
earlier effort to find salvation through pure reason in obedience
to the law of the whole, although it may have been magnificent,
was not a working religion for man as he is constituted. The
eternal involution of spirit and matter in the old Stoic creed,
the cold, impersonal, unknowable power, which, under whatever
name, Law, Reason, Fate, Necessity, permeates the universe,
necessarily exclude the idea of design, of providence, of moral
care for humanity. The unknown Power which claims an
absolute obedience, has no aid or recognition for his worshipper.
The monism of the old Stoics breaks down. The human
spirit, in striving to realise its unity with the Universal Spirit,
realises with more and more intensity the perpetual opposition
of matter and spirit, while it receives no aid in the conflict from
the power which ordains it; it <span class="tei tei-q">“finds itself alone in an alien
world.”</span> The true Stoic has no real object of worship. If he
addresses the impassive centre and soul of his universe, sometimes
in the rapturous tones of loving devotion, it is only a
pathetic illusion born of the faiths of the past, or inspired by a
dim forecast of the faiths of the coming time. How could the
complex of blind forces arouse any devotion? It demanded
implicit submission and self-sacrifice, but it gave no help,
save the name of a Divine element in the human soul; it
furnished no inspiring example to the sage in the conflicts of
passion, under obloquy, obstruction, and persecution. Meanwhile,
in this forlorn struggle, the human character was through
stress and storm developing new powers and virtues, lofty
courage in the face of lawless power, pious resignation to the
blows of fortune, gentle consideration and mercy even for
slaves and the outcasts of society, ideals of purity unknown to
the ancient world in its prime. The sage might, according to
orthodox theory, rest in a placid content of rounded perfection.
But human nature is not so constituted. In proportion to
spiritual progress is the force of spiritual longings; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">beati
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">mundo corde, ipsi Deum videbunt</span></span>. The fruitful part of
Stoicism as a religion was the doctrine that the human reason
is a part of the soul of the world, a spark of the Divine mind.
At first this was only conceived in the fashion of a materialistic
pantheism.<a id="noteref_2058" name="noteref_2058" href="#note_2058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2058</span></span></a> The kindred between the individual and the
general soul was little more than a physical doctrine. But it
developed in minds like Epictetus and Seneca a profound
spiritual meaning; it tapped the source of all real religion.
Pure reason can never solve the religious problem. The
history of religions shows that a conception of God which is
to act effectually on composite human nature is never reached
by the speculative intellect. What reason cannot do is effected
by the <span class="tei tei-q">“sub-conscious self,”</span><a id="noteref_2059" name="noteref_2059" href="#note_2059"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2059</span></span></a> which is the dim seat of the
deeper intuitions, haunted by vague memories, hereditary
pieties, and emotional associations, the spring of strange
genius, of heroic sacrifice, of infinite aspiration. There throbs
the tide <span class="tei tei-q">“which drew from out the boundless deep.”</span> Thus
the Stoic of the later time became a mystic, in the sense
that <span class="tei tei-q">“by love and emotion he solved the dualism of
the world.”</span><a id="noteref_2060" name="noteref_2060" href="#note_2060"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2060</span></span></a> God is no longer a mere physical law or
force, however subtilised, sweeping on in pitiless impetus or
monotony of cyclic change. God is within the human soul,
not as a spark of empyreal fire, but as the voice of conscience,
the spiritual monitor and comforter, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Spirit,”</span><a id="noteref_2061" name="noteref_2061" href="#note_2061"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2061</span></span></a>
prompting, guarding, consoling in life and death. God is no
longer found so much in the ordered movement of the
spheres and the recurring processes or the cataclysms of the
material universe. He is heard in the still small voice.
It is thus that the later Stoicism melts into the revived
Platonism.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Probably Seneca and Epictetus, had they been interrogated,
would have loyally resolved their most rapturous and devout
language into the cold terms of Stoic orthodoxy. But the
emotional tone is a really new element in their teaching, and
the language of spiritual abandonment, joyful resignation to a
Higher Will, free and cheerful obedience to it in the confidence
of love, would be absurdly incongruous if addressed to an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>abstract law or physical necessity.<a id="noteref_2062" name="noteref_2062" href="#note_2062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2062</span></span></a> The fatherhood of God
and the kinship of all men as His sons is the fundamental
principle of the new creed, binding us to do nothing unworthy
of such an ancestry.<a id="noteref_2063" name="noteref_2063" href="#note_2063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2063</span></span></a> At other times we are soldiers of God
in a war with evil, bound to military obedience, awaiting calmly
the last signal to retreat from the scene of struggle.<a id="noteref_2064" name="noteref_2064" href="#note_2064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2064</span></span></a> The
infinite benevolence of God is asserted in the face of all appearances
to the contrary. This of course is all the easier to one
trained in the doctrine that the external fortune of life has
nothing to do with man’s real happiness. The fear of God is
banished by the sense of His perfect love. The all-seeing eye,
the all-embracing providence, leave no room for care or foreboding.
The Stoic optimism is now grounded on a personal
trust in a loving and righteous will: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Thine, do with me
what Thou wilt.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“For all things work together for good to
them who love Him.”</span> The external sufferings and apparent
wrongs of the obedient sons of God are no stumbling-blocks to
faith.<a id="noteref_2065" name="noteref_2065" href="#note_2065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2065</span></span></a> The great heroic example, Heracles, the son of Zeus,
was sorely tried by superhuman tasks, and won his crown of
immortality through toil and battle. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom He loves He
chastens.”</span> Even apparent injustice is only an education through
suffering. These things are <span class="tei tei-q">“only light afflictions”</span> to him who
sees the due proportions of things and knows Zeus as his father.
Even to the poor, the lame, the blind, if they have the divine
love, the universe is a great temple, full of mystery and joy,
and each passing day a festival. In the common things of life,
in ploughing, digging, eating, we should sing hymns to God.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What else can I do,”</span> says Epictetus, <span class="tei tei-q">“a lame old man, than sing
His praise, and exhort all men to join in the same song?”</span><a id="noteref_2066" name="noteref_2066" href="#note_2066"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2066</span></span></a>
Who shall say what depth of religious emotion, veiled under old-world
phrase, there was in that outburst of M. Aurelius: <span class="tei tei-q">“All
harmonises with me which is in harmony with thee, O Universe.
Nothing for me is too early nor too late which is in due season
for thee.... For thee are all things, in thee are all things,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to thee all things return. The poet says, Dear City of Cecrops;
and wilt not thou say, Dear City of Zeus?”</span><a id="noteref_2067" name="noteref_2067" href="#note_2067"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2067</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The attitude of such souls to external worship in every
age may be easily divined without the evidence of their words.
If God is good and wishes only the good of His creatures,
then to seek to appease His wrath and avert His capricious
judgments becomes an impiety. If men’s final good lies in
the moral sphere, in justice, gentleness, temperance, obedience
to the higher order, then prayer for external goods, for mere
indulgences of sense or ambition, shows a hopeless misconception
as to the nature of God and the supreme destiny of
man.<a id="noteref_2068" name="noteref_2068" href="#note_2068"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2068</span></span></a> On the other hand, without giving up the doctrine
that the highest good depends on the virtuous will, the later
Stoics and Platonists have begun to feel that man needs
support and inspiration in his moral struggles from a higher
Power, a Power without him and beyond him, yet who is allied
to him in nature and sympathy. Prayer is no longer a means
of winning temporal good things <span class="tei tei-q">“for which the worthy need
not pray, and which the unworthy will not obtain.”</span> It is a
fortifying communion with the Highest, an act of thanksgiving
for blessings already received, an inspiration for a fuller and
diviner life.<a id="noteref_2069" name="noteref_2069" href="#note_2069"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2069</span></span></a> It is an effort of gratitude and adoration to draw
from the Divine source of all moral strength.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must always remain to moderns an enigma how souls
living in such a spiritual world refused to break with heathen
idolatry. Seneca, indeed, poured contempt on the grossness
of myth in a lost treatise on superstition;<a id="noteref_2070" name="noteref_2070" href="#note_2070"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2070</span></span></a> and he had no
liking for the external rites of worship. But in some
strange way M. Aurelius reconciled punctilious devotion to
the popular gods with an austere pantheism or monotheism.
It is in Platonists such as Dion or Maximus of Tyre that
we meet with an attempted apology for anthropomorphic
symbolism of the Divine.<a id="noteref_2071" name="noteref_2071" href="#note_2071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2071</span></span></a> The justification lies in the vast
gulf which separates the remote, ineffable, and inconceivable
purity of God from the feebleness and grossness of man. Few
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>are they who can gaze in unaided thought on the Divine
splendour unveiled. Images, rites, and sacred myth have
been invented by the wisdom of the past, to aid the memory
and the imagination of weak ordinary souls. The symbols
have varied with the endless variety of races. Animals or
trees, mountain or river, rude unhewn stones, or the miracles of
Pheidias in gold and ivory, are simply the sign or picture by
which the soul is pointed to the Infinite Essence which has
never been seen by mortal eye or imaged in human phantasy.
The symbol which appeals to one race may be poor and contemptible
in the eyes of another. The animal worship of
Egypt gave a shock to minds which were lifted heavenwards by
the winning majesty of the Virgin Goddess or of the Zeus of
Olympia. The human form, as the chosen tabernacle of an
effluence of the Divine Spirit, might well seem to Dion and
Maximus the noblest and most fitting symbol of religious
worship. Yet, in the end, they are all ready to tolerate any
aberration of religious fancy which is justified by its use.<a id="noteref_2072" name="noteref_2072" href="#note_2072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2072</span></span></a>
The most perfect symbol is only a faint adumbration of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Father and Creator of all, Who is older than the sun and
heavens, stronger than time and the ages and the fleeting
world of change, unnamed by any lawgiver, Whom tongue
cannot express nor eye see. Helpless to grasp His real
essence, we seek a stay in names or images, in beast or
plant, in river or mountain, in lustrous forms of gold and
silver and ivory. Whatever we have of fairest we call by His
name. And for love of Him, we cling, as lovers are wont, to
anything which recalls Him. I quarrel not with divers
imagery, if we seek to know, to love, to remember Him.”</span><a id="noteref_2073" name="noteref_2073" href="#note_2073"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2073</span></span></a>
This is the outburst of a tolerant and eclectic Platonism, ready
to condone everything in the crudest religious imagery. But
a more conscientious scrutiny even of Grecian legend demanded,
as we shall see, a deeper solution to account for dark rites and
legends which cast a shadow on the Infinite Purity.

no haunting charm of poetic imagination attached,<a id="noteref_2075" name="noteref_2075" href="#note_2075"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2075</span></span></a> easily lent
itself to a system which explained the gods by allegory or
physical rationalism. That was not an eirenicon for the
second century, at least among thoughtful, pious men. The
philosophic effort of so many centuries had ended in an
eclecticism for purely moral culture, and a profound scepticism
as to the attainment of higher truth by unaided reason.<a id="noteref_2076" name="noteref_2076" href="#note_2076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2076</span></span></a> Mere
intellectual curiosity, the desire of knowledge for its own sake,
and the hope of attaining it, are strangely absent from the
loftiest minds, from Seneca, Epictetus, and M. Aurelius.<a id="noteref_2077" name="noteref_2077" href="#note_2077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2077</span></span></a> Men

the immense force of that spiritual movement which was
trying every avenue of accredited religious system or novel
superstition, that might perchance lead the devotee to some
glimpse of the divine world. And side by side with the
recrudescence of old-world superstitions, there were spreading,
from whatever source, loftier and more ethical conceptions of
God, a dim sense of sin and human weakness, a need of
cleansing and support from a Divine hand. Stoicism, with all
its austere grandeur, had failed in its interpretation both of
man and of God. Popular theology, however soothing to old
associations and unregenerate feelings, often gave a shock to
the quickened moral sense and the higher spiritual intuitions.
Yet the venerable charm of time-honoured ritual, glad or
stately, the emotional effects and dim promise of revelation in
the mysteries of many shrines, the seductive allurements of new
cults, with a strange blending of the sensuous and the mystic,
all wove around the human soul such an enchanted maze of
spiritual fascination that escape was impossible, even if it were
desired. But it was no longer desired even by the highest
intellects. The efforts of pure reason to solve the mystery of
God and of man’s destiny had failed. Yet men were ever
<span class="tei tei-q">“feeling after God, if haply they might find Him.”</span> And the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>God whom they sought for was one on whom they might hang,
in whom they might have rest. Where was the revelation to
come from? Where was the mediator to be sought to reconcile
the ancient faiths or fables with a purified conception of the
Deity and the aspiration for a higher moral life?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The revived Pythagorean and Platonist philosophy which
girded itself to attempt the solution was really part of a great
spiritual movement, with its focus at Alexandria.<a id="noteref_2079" name="noteref_2079" href="#note_2079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2079</span></span></a> In that
meeting-point of the East and West, of all systems of thought
and worship, syncretism blended all faiths. Hadrian, in his
letter to Servianus, cynically observes that the same men were
ready to worship impartially Serapis or Christ.<a id="noteref_2080" name="noteref_2080" href="#note_2080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2080</span></span></a> Philosophy
became more and more a religion; its first and highest aim
is a right knowledge of God. And philosophy, having failed
to find help in the life according to nature, or the divine
element in individual consciousness, had now to seek support
in a God transcending nature and consciousness, a God such as
the mysticism of the East or the systems of Pythagoras and
Plato had foreshadowed. But such a God, transcending nature
and consciousness, remote, ineffable, only, in some rare moment
of supreme exaltation, dimly apprehensible by the human
spirit,<a id="noteref_2081" name="noteref_2081" href="#note_2081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2081</span></span></a> could not call forth fully the loving trust and fervent
reverence which men longed to offer. Heaven being so far from
earth, and earth so darkened by the mists of sense, any gleam
of revelation must be welcomed from whatever quarter it
might break. And thus an all-embracing syncretism, while it
gratified ancestral piety, and the natural instinct of all religion
to root itself in the past, offered the hope of illumination from
converging lights. Or rather, any religion which has won the
reverence of men may transmit a ray from the central Sun.
The believer in God, who longs for communion with Him, for
help at His hands, might by reverent selection win from all
religions something to satisfy his needs. A revelation was the
imperious demand. Where should men be so likely to find it
as in the reverent study of great historic efforts of humanity
to pierce the veil?

The philosophy which was to attempt the revival of
paganism in the second century, and which was to fight its
last battles in the fourth and fifth, traced itself to Pythagoras
and Plato. Plato’s affinity with the older mystic is well known.
And the reader of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span> or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Republic</span></span> will not be surprised
to find the followers of the two masters of Greek thought
who believed most in a spiritual vision and in an ordered
moral life, united in an effort which extended to the close of the
Western Empire,<a id="noteref_2082" name="noteref_2082" href="#note_2082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2082</span></span></a> to combine a lofty mysticism with ancestral
faith. The two systems had much in common, and yet each
contributed a peculiar element to the great movement. Pythagoreanism,
although its origin is veiled in mystery, was always
full of the mysticism of the East. Platonism was essentially
the philosophy of Greek culture. The movement in which
their forces were combined was one in which the new Hellenism of
Hadrian’s reign reinforced itself for the reconstruction of western
paganism with those purer and loftier ideas of God of which the
East is the original home. The effort of paganism to rehabilitate
itself in the second century drew no small part of its inspiration
from the regions which were the cradle of the Christian faith.<a id="noteref_2083" name="noteref_2083" href="#note_2083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2083</span></span></a>

spiritual creed congenial to paganism is shown by the fact that
Iamblichus, one of the latest Neo-Platonists, and one of the
ardent devotees of superstition, expounded the Pythagorean
system in many treatises and composed an imaginative biography
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the great founder.<a id="noteref_2088" name="noteref_2088" href="#note_2088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2088</span></span></a> To the modern it is best known

the wife of Septimius Severus, who combined with a doubtful
virtue a love for the mysticism of her native East.<a id="noteref_2089" name="noteref_2089" href="#note_2089"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2089</span></span></a> Apollonius
is surrounded by his biographer with an atmosphere of mystery
and miracle. But although the critical historian must reject
much of the narrative, the faith of the Pythagorean missionary
of the reign of Domitian stands out in clear outline.
Apollonius is a true representative of the new spiritual
movement. His mother had a vision before his birth. His
early training at Aegae was eclectic, like the spirit of the age,
and he heard the teaching of doctors of all the schools, not
even excluding the Epicurean.<a id="noteref_2090" name="noteref_2090" href="#note_2090"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2090</span></span></a> But he early devoted himself
to the severe asceticism of the Pythagorean sect, wore pure
linen, abstained from wine and flesh, observed the five years
of silence, and made the temple his home. The worship of
Asclepius, which was then gaining an extraordinary vogue, had
a special attraction for him, with its atmosphere of serenity
and ritual purity and its dream oracles of beneficent healing.
Apollonius combines in a strange fashion, like Plutarch and
the eclectic Platonists, a decided monotheism with a conservative
devotion to the ancient gods. He looks to the East, to
the sages of the Ganges, for the highest inspiration. He
worships the sun every day.<a id="noteref_2091" name="noteref_2091" href="#note_2091"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2091</span></span></a> Yet he has a profound interest
in the popular religion of the many lands through which he
travelled. He frequented the temples of all the gods, discoursed
with the priests on the ancient lore of their shrines,
and corrected or restored, with an authority which seems to
have never been challenged, their ritual where it had been
forgotten or mutilated in the lapse of ages.<a id="noteref_2092" name="noteref_2092" href="#note_2092"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2092</span></span></a> He sought initiation
in all the mysteries. He wrote a book on Sacrifices which
dealt with the most minute details of worship.<a id="noteref_2093" name="noteref_2093" href="#note_2093"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2093</span></span></a> He had a
profound interest in ancient legend, and the fame of the great
Hellenic heroes, and, having spent a weird night with the
shade of Achilles in the Troad, he constrained the Thessalians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to restore his fallen honours.<a id="noteref_2094" name="noteref_2094" href="#note_2094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2094</span></span></a> The temples recognised in him
at once a champion and a reformer. The oracular seats of
Ionia showed an unenvious admiration of his gift of prophecy,
and hailed him as a true son of Apollo.<a id="noteref_2095" name="noteref_2095" href="#note_2095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2095</span></span></a> His visit to Rome
in the darkest hour of the Neronian terror seems to have
aroused a strange religious fervour; the temples were thronged
with worshippers; it was a heathen revival.<a id="noteref_2096" name="noteref_2096" href="#note_2096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2096</span></span></a>

Yet this strange missionary held principles which ought to
have been fatal to heathen worship. He drew his central
principle from Eastern pantheism, which might seem irreconcilable
with the anthropomorphism of the West. It is true
that under the Infinite Spirit, as in the Platonist théodicée, the
gods of heathen devotion find a place as His ministers and
viceroys.<a id="noteref_2097" name="noteref_2097" href="#note_2097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2097</span></span></a> But the eternal antithesis of spirit and matter, and

flesh and attenuating its powers, the spirit might lay itself open
to heavenly influences, these are doctrines which might appear
utterly hostile to a gross materialist ritual. And as a matter
of fact, Apollonius to some extent obeyed his principles. He
scorned the popular conception of divination and magic.<a id="noteref_2099" name="noteref_2099" href="#note_2099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2099</span></span></a> The
only legitimate power of foreseeing the future or influencing
the material world is given to the soul which is pure from all
fleshly taint and therefore near to God. He feels profoundly
that the myths propagated by the poets have lowered the ideal
of God and the character of man, and he greatly prefers the
fables of Aesop, which use the falsehoods of the fancy for a
definite moral end.<a id="noteref_2100" name="noteref_2100" href="#note_2100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2100</span></span></a> The mutilation of a father, the storming
of Olympus by the Giants, incest and adultery among the gods,
must be reprobated, however they have been glorified by poetry.
Apollonius poured contempt on the animal worship of Egypt,
even when defended by the dialectic subtlety of Greece.<a id="noteref_2101" name="noteref_2101" href="#note_2101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2101</span></span></a> He
was repelled by the grossness of bloody sacrifices, however consecrated
by immemorial use. For the nobler symbolism of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hellenic art he had a certain sympathy, like Dion, but only as
symbolism. Any sensible image of the Supreme, which does
not carry the soul beyond the bounds of sense, defeats its
purpose and is degrading to pure religion. Pictured or
sculptured forms are only aids to that mystic imagination
through which alone we can see God. Finally, his idea of
prayer is intensely spiritual or ethical. <span class="tei tei-q">“Grant me, ye gods,
what is my due”</span> is the highest prayer of Apollonius.<a id="noteref_2102" name="noteref_2102" href="#note_2102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2102</span></span></a> Yet, as
we have already seen, the religion of Apollonius is thoroughly
practical. He was a great preacher. He addressed vast
crowds from the temple steps at Ephesus or Olympia, rebuking
their luxury and effeminacy, their feuds and mean civic ambition,
their love of frivolous sports or the bloody strife of the arena.<a id="noteref_2103" name="noteref_2103" href="#note_2103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2103</span></span></a>
Next to the knowledge of God, he preached the importance of
self-knowledge, and of lending an attentive ear to the voice of
conscience. He crowned his life by asserting fearlessly the cause
of righteousness in the awful presence-chamber of Domitian.

About the very time when Apollonius was bearding the last
of the Flavians, and preaching a pagan revival in the porticoes
of the Roman temples, it is probable that Plutarch, in some
respects a kindred spirit, was making his appearance as a lecturer
at Rome.<a id="noteref_2104" name="noteref_2104" href="#note_2104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2104</span></span></a> The greatest of biographers has had no authentic

be gleaned from his own writings. He was the descendant of
an ancient family of Chaeronea, famous as the scene of three
historic battles, <span class="tei tei-q">“the War-God’s dancing-place,”</span> and his great-grandfather
had tales of the great conflict at Actium.<a id="noteref_2106" name="noteref_2106" href="#note_2106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2106</span></span></a> In the
year 66 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, when Nero was distinguishing or disgracing himself
as a competitor at the Greek festivals, Plutarch was a
young student at the university of Athens, under Ammonius,<a id="noteref_2107" name="noteref_2107" href="#note_2107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2107</span></span></a>
who, if he inspired him with admiration for Plato, also taught
him to draw freely from all the treasures of Greek thought.
Plutarch, before he finally settled down at Chaeronea, saw
something of the great Roman world. He had visited
Alex<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>andria and some part of Asia Minor.<a id="noteref_2108" name="noteref_2108" href="#note_2108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2108</span></span></a> He was at an early age
employed to represent his native town on public business,<a id="noteref_2109" name="noteref_2109" href="#note_2109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2109</span></span></a> and
he had thus visited Rome, probably in the reign of Vespasian,
and again, in the reign of
Domitian.<a id="noteref_2110" name="noteref_2110" href="#note_2110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2110</span></span></a> It was a time when

It was also the age of the new sophist. Hellenism was in the air,
and the lecture theatres were thronged to hear the philosophic
orator or the professional artist in words.<a id="noteref_2112" name="noteref_2112" href="#note_2112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2112</span></span></a> Although Plutarch is

of whom belonged to the circle of Pliny and Tacitus.<a id="noteref_2114" name="noteref_2114" href="#note_2114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2114</span></span></a>

But his native Greece, with its great memories, and his
native Chaeronea, to which he was linked by ancestral piety,
had for a man like Plutarch far stronger charms than the
capital of the world. With our love of excitement and
personal prominence, it is hard to conceive how a man of
immense culture and brilliant literary power could endure the
monotony of bourgeois society in depopulated and decaying
Greece.<a id="noteref_2115" name="noteref_2115" href="#note_2115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2115</span></span></a> Yet Plutarch seems to have found it easy, and even
pleasant. He was too great to allow his own scheme of life
to be crossed and disturbed by vulgar opinion or ephemeral
ambition. His family relations were sweet and happy. His
married life realised the highest ideals of happy wedlock.<a id="noteref_2116" name="noteref_2116" href="#note_2116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2116</span></span></a> He
had the respectful affection of his brothers and older kinsmen.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his native town, were dignified in his eyes by the thought
that Epameinondas had once been charged with the cleansing of
the streets of Thebes.<a id="noteref_2117" name="noteref_2117" href="#note_2117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2117</span></span></a> His priesthood of Apollo at Delphi

ancient shrine which looked down on the gulf from the foot
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Shining Rocks,”</span> was sacred as no other spot on earth.
Although in Plutarch’s day Delphi had declined in splendour
and fame,<a id="noteref_2119" name="noteref_2119" href="#note_2119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2119</span></span></a> it was still surrounded with the glamour of
immemorial sanctity and power. It was still the spot from
which divine voices of warning or counsel had issued to the
kings of Lydia, to chiefs of wild hordes upon the Strymon,
to the envoys of the Roman Tarquins, to every city of
Hellenic name from the Euxine to the Atlantic. We can
still almost make the round of its antiquarian treasures under
his genial guidance. Probably Plutarch’s happiest hours were
spent in accompanying a party of visitors,—a professor on his
way home from Britain to Tarsus, a Spartan traveller just returned
from far Indian seas,—around those sacred scenes; we
can hear the debate on the doubtful quality of Delphic verse or
the sources of its inspiration: we can watch them pause to
recall the story of mouldering bronze or marble, and wake the
echoes of a thousand years.<a id="noteref_2120" name="noteref_2120" href="#note_2120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2120</span></span></a>

Plutarch must have been a swift and indefatigable worker,
for his production is almost on the scale of Varro, Cicero, or
the elder Pliny. Yet he found time for pleasant visits to
every part of Greece which had tales or treasures for the
antiquary. He enjoyed the friendship of the brightest intellects
of the day, of Herodes Atticus, the millionaire rhetorician,<a id="noteref_2121" name="noteref_2121" href="#note_2121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2121</span></span></a>
of Favorinus, the great sophist of Gaul, the intimate friend
of Herodes and the counsellor of the Emperor Hadrian, of
Ammonius, who was Plutarch’s tutor; of many others, noted
in their time, but who are mere shadows to us. They met
in a convivial way in many places, at Chaeronea, at Hyampolis,
at Eleusis after the Mysteries, at Patrae, at Corinth during
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Isthmian games, at Thermopylae, and Athens in the

in the end of the first century is invaluable to the student of
society. In such scenes Plutarch not only cultivated friendship,
the great art of life, not only watched the play of intellect
and character; he also found relief from the austere labours
which have made his fame. It is surely not the least of his
titles to greatness that, in an environment which to most men
of talent would have been infinitely depressing, with the
irrepressible vitality of genius he contrived to idealise the
society of decaying Greece by linking it with the past.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, with such a power of reviving the past, even the
dulness of the little Boeotian town was easily tolerable. We
can imagine Plutarch looking down the quiet street in the
still vacant noontide, as he sat trying to revive the ancient
glories of his race, and to match them with their conquerors,
while he reminded the lords of the world, who, in Plutarch’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>early youth, seemed to be wildly squandering their heritage, of
the stern, simple virtue by which it had been won. For in the
Lives of great Greeks and Romans, the moral interest is the
most prominent. It is biography, not history, which Plutarch
is writing.<a id="noteref_2129" name="noteref_2129" href="#note_2129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2129</span></span></a> Setting and scenery of course there must be; but
Plutarch’s chief object is to paint the character of the great
actors on the stage. Hence he may slur over or omit historic
facts of wider interest, while he records apparently trivial
incidents or sayings which light up a character. But Plutarch
has a fine eye both for lively social scenes and the great
crises of history. The description of the feverish activity of
swarming industry in the great days of Pheidias at Athens, once
read, can never be forgotten.<a id="noteref_2130" name="noteref_2130" href="#note_2130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2130</span></span></a> Equally indelible are the pictures

Pompey, of the suicide of Otho on the ghastly field of Bedriacum,
which seemed to atone for an evil life. Nor can we
forget his description of one of the saddest of all scenes in Greek
history, which moved even Thucydides to a restrained pathos,—the
retreat of the Athenians from the walls of Syracuse.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch was before all else a moralist, with a genius for
religion. His ethical treatises deserve to be thoroughly explored,
and as sympathetically expounded, for the light which they
throw on the moral aspirations of the age, as Dr. Mahaffy has
skilfully used them for pictures of its social life. He must
be a very unimaginative person who cannot feel the charm of
their revelation. But the man of purely speculative interest
will probably be disappointed. Plutarch is not an original
thinker in morals or religion. He has no new gospel to expound.
He does not go to the roots of conduct or faith. Possessing
a very wide knowledge of past speculation, he might have
written an invaluable history of ancient philosophy. But he
has not done it. And, as a man of genius, with a strong
practical purpose to do moral good to his fellows, his choice of
his vocation must be accepted without cavil. He was the
greatest Hellenist of his day, when Hellenism was capturing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Roman world. He was also a man of high moral ideals,
sincere piety, and absorbing interest in the fate of human
character. With all that wealth of learning, philosophic or
historical, with all that knowledge of human nature, what
nobler task could a man set himself than to attempt to give
some practical guidance to a generation conscious of moral
weakness, and distracted between new spiritual ideals and the
mythologies of the past? The urgent need for moral culture and
reform of character, for a guiding force in conduct, was profoundly
felt by all the great serious minds of the Flavian age, by
Pliny and Tacitus, by Juvenal and Quintilian. But Plutarch
probably felt it more acutely than any, and took endless pains
to satisfy it. It was an age when the philosophic director and
the philosophic preacher were, as we have seen, to be met with
everywhere. And Plutarch took his full share in the movement,
and influenced a wide circle.<a id="noteref_2132" name="noteref_2132" href="#note_2132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2132</span></span></a> If he did not elaborate an
original ethical system, he had studied closely the art of
moral reform, and Christian homilists, from Basil to Jeremy
Taylor, have drawn freely from the storehouse of his precept
and observation. In many tracts he has analysed prevailing
vices and faults of his time,—flattery, vain curiosity, irritable
temper, or false modesty,—and given rules for curing or avoiding
them. In these homilies, the fundamental principle is that of
Musonius, perhaps adapted from an oracle to the people of
Cirrha <span class="tei tei-q">“to wage war with vice day and night, and never to
relax your guard.”</span><a id="noteref_2133" name="noteref_2133" href="#note_2133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2133</span></span></a> The call to reform sounded all the louder
in Plutarch’s ears because of the high ideal which he had conceived
of what life might be made if, no longer left to the play of
passion and random influences, character were moulded from
early youth to a temperate harmony. To such a soul each
passing day might be a glad festival, the universe an august
temple full of its Maker’s glories, and life an initiation into the
joy of its holy mysteries.<a id="noteref_2134" name="noteref_2134" href="#note_2134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2134</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the work of moral and religious reconstruction Plutarch
and his contemporaries could only rely on philosophy as their
guide. Philosophy to Plutarch, Apollonius, or M. Aurelius,
had a very different meaning from what it bore to the great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thinkers of Ionia and Magna Graecia. Not only had it
deserted the field of metaphysical speculation; it had lost
interest even in the mere theory of morals. It had become
the art rather than the science of life. The teacher of an art
cannot indeed entirely divorce it from all scientific theory.
The relative importance of practical precept and ethical theory
was often debated in that age. But the tendency was
undoubtedly to subordinate dogma to edification.<a id="noteref_2135" name="noteref_2135" href="#note_2135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2135</span></span></a> And where
dogma was needed for practical effect, it might be drawn from
the most opposite quarters. Seneca delights in rounding off a
letter by a quotation from Epicurus. M. Aurelius appeals
both to the example of Epicurus and the teaching of Plato.<a id="noteref_2136" name="noteref_2136" href="#note_2136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2136</span></span></a>
Man might toy with cosmic speculation; the Timaeus had
many commentators in the first and second centuries.<a id="noteref_2137" name="noteref_2137" href="#note_2137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2137</span></span></a> But,
for Plutarch and his contemporaries, the great task of philosophy
was to bring some sort of order into the moral and
religious chaos. It was not original thought or discovery
which was needed, but the application of reason, cultivated by
the study of the past, to the moral and religious problems of
the present. The philosopher sometimes, to our eyes, seems to
trifle with the smallest details of exterior deportment or idiom
or dress; he gives precepts about the rearing of children; he
occupies himself with curious questions of ritual and antiquarian
interest.<a id="noteref_2138" name="noteref_2138" href="#note_2138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2138</span></span></a> These seeming degradations of a great mission, after
all, only emphasise the fact that philosophy was now concerned
with human life rather than with the problems of speculation.
It had in fact become an all-embracing religion. It supplied the
medicine for moral disease; it furnished the rational criterion
by which all myth and ritual must be judged or explained.<a id="noteref_2139" name="noteref_2139" href="#note_2139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2139</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch was an eclectic in the sense that, knowing all the
moral systems of the past, he was ready to borrow from any
of these principles which might give support to character.
Whether, if he had been born four or five hundred years
earlier, he might have created or developed an original theory
himself, is a question which may be variously answered. One
may reasonably hesitate to assent to the common opinion that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Plutarch had no genius for original speculation. Had he come
under the influence of Socrates, it is not so certain that he
might not have composed dialogues with a certain charm of
fresh dialectic and picturesque dramatic power. It is a little
unhistorical to decry a man of genius as wanting in speculative
originality, who was born into an age when speculation had run
dry, and thought was only subsidiary to conduct. When the
dissonant schools forsook the heights of metaphysic and cosmology
to devote themselves to moral culture, an inevitable tendency
to eclecticism, to a harmony of moral theory, set in. The
practical interest prevailed over the infinitely divisive forces
of the speculative reason. Antiochus, the teacher of Cicero,<a id="noteref_2140" name="noteref_2140" href="#note_2140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2140</span></span></a>
while he strove to re-establish Platonism, maintained the
essential agreement of the great schools on the all-important
questions, and freely adopted the doctrines of Zeno and
Aristotle.<a id="noteref_2141" name="noteref_2141" href="#note_2141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2141</span></span></a> Panaetius, the chief representative of Roman
Stoicism in the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, had a warm admiration
for Plato and Aristotle, and in some essential points forsook
the older teaching of the Porch.<a id="noteref_2142" name="noteref_2142" href="#note_2142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2142</span></span></a> Seneca, as we have seen,
often seems to cling to the most hard and repellent tenets of
the ancient creed. Yet a sense of practical difficulties has led
him to soften and modify many of them—the identity of
reason and passion, the indifference of so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“goods,”</span> the
necessity of instantaneous conversion, the unapproachable and
unassailable perfection of the wise man. Plutarch’s own
ethical system, so far as he has a system, is a compound of
Platonic and Aristotelian ideas, with a certain tincture of
Stoicism.<a id="noteref_2143" name="noteref_2143" href="#note_2143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2143</span></span></a> Platonism, which had shaken off its sceptical
tendencies in the first century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, had few adherents at
Rome in the first century of the Empire.<a id="noteref_2144" name="noteref_2144" href="#note_2144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2144</span></span></a> The Stoic and
Epicurean systems divided the allegiance of thinking people
till the energetic revival of Hellenism set in. Epictetus
indeed speaks of women who were attracted by the supposed
freedom of sexual relations in Plato’s Utopia.<a id="noteref_2145" name="noteref_2145" href="#note_2145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2145</span></span></a> Seneca often
refers to Plato, and was undoubtedly influenced by his spirit.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>But in the second century, the sympathetic union of Platonic
and Pythagorean ideas with a vigorous religious revival became
a real power, with momentous effects on the future of
philosophy and religion for three centuries. Plutarch’s reverence
for the founder of the Academy, even in little things, was
unbounded.<a id="noteref_2146" name="noteref_2146" href="#note_2146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2146</span></span></a> It became with him almost a kind of cult. And
he paid the most sincere reverence to his idol by imitating, in
some of his treatises, the mythical colouring by which the
author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Republic</span></span> had sought to give body
and reality to the unseen world.<a id="noteref_2147" name="noteref_2147" href="#note_2147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2147</span></span></a> Plutarch condemned in very
strong language the coarse and sophistical modes of controversy
with which the rival schools assailed one another’s tenets.<a id="noteref_2148" name="noteref_2148" href="#note_2148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2148</span></span></a>
Yet he can hardly be acquitted of some harshness in his
polemic against the Stoics and Epicureans. Archbishop Trench,
in his fascinating and sympathetic treatment of Plutarch,
laments that he did not give a more generous recognition to
that noblest and most truly Roman school which was the last
refuge and citadel of freedom.<a id="noteref_2149" name="noteref_2149" href="#note_2149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2149</span></span></a> We may join the archbishop
in wishing that Plutarch, without compromising principle, had
been more tolerant to a system with which he had so much in
common, and which, in his day, had put off much of its old
hardness. But he was essentially a practical man, with a
definite moral aim. He took from any quarter principles
which seemed to him to be true to human nature, and which
furnished a hopeful basis for the efforts of the moral teacher.
But he felt equally bound to reject a system which absorbed
and annihilated the emotional nature in the reason,<a id="noteref_2150" name="noteref_2150" href="#note_2150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2150</span></span></a> which cut
at the roots of moral freedom, which recognised no degrees in
virtue or in vice, which discouraged and contemned the first
faint struggles of weak humanity after a higher life, and froze
it into hopeless impotence by the remote ideal of a cold, flawless
perfection, suddenly and miraculously raised to a divine
independence of all the minor blessings and helps to virtue.<a id="noteref_2151" name="noteref_2151" href="#note_2151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2151</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Such an ideal may be magnificent, but it is not life. For man,
constituted as he is, and placed in such an environment, it is
a dangerous mental habit to train the soul to regard all things
as a fleeting and monotonous show, to cultivate the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">taedium
vitae</span></span>, or a calm resignation to the littleness of man placed for
a brief space between the two eternities.<a id="noteref_2152" name="noteref_2152" href="#note_2152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2152</span></span></a> The philosophic
sufferer may brace himself to endure the round of human
duties, and to live for the commonwealth of man; he may he
generous to the ungrateful and tolerant to the vulgar and the
frivolous; he may make his life a perpetual sacrifice to duty
and the higher law, but it is all the while really a pathetic
protest against the pitiless Power which has made man so little
and so great, doomed to the life of the leaves and the insects,
yet tortured with the longing for an infinite future.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On some great central truths, such as the inwardness of
happiness and the brotherhood of man, Plutarch and the Stoics
were at one. And the general tone of his moral teaching
bears many marks of Stoic influence.<a id="noteref_2153" name="noteref_2153" href="#note_2153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2153</span></span></a> But the Stoic psychology,
the Stoic fatalism and pantheism aroused all the controversial
vehemence of Plutarch.<a id="noteref_2154" name="noteref_2154" href="#note_2154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2154</span></span></a> The Stoic held the essential unity
of the soul, that reason and passion are not two distinct
principles, but that passion is reason depraved and diverted to
wrong objects. It is the same simple, indivisible power which
shifts and changes and submits itself to opposing influences.
Passion, in fact, is an impetuous and erring motion of the
reason, and vice, in the old Socratic phrase, is an error of judgment,
a fit of ignorance of the true ends of action. But as,
according to Stoic theory, the human reason is a portion of
the Divine, depravity becomes thus a corruption of the Divine
element, and the guarantee for any hope of reform is lost.
For himself, Plutarch adopts the Platonic division of the soul
into the rational, spirited, and concupiscent elements, with some
Aristotelian modifications.<a id="noteref_2155" name="noteref_2155" href="#note_2155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2155</span></span></a> The great fact of man’s moral
nature is the natural opposition between the passions and the
rational element of the soul; it corresponds to a similar
division in the mundane soul.<a id="noteref_2156" name="noteref_2156" href="#note_2156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2156</span></span></a> All experience attests a
    con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stant, natural, and sustained rebellion of the lower against the
higher. Principles so alien and disparate cannot be identified,
any more than you can identify the hunter and his quarry.<a id="noteref_2157" name="noteref_2157" href="#note_2157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2157</span></span></a>
But, although in the unregulated character, they are in violent
opposition, they may, by proper culture, be brought at last
into a harmony. The function of the higher element is not
to extinguish the lower, but to guide and control and elevate
it.<a id="noteref_2158" name="noteref_2158" href="#note_2158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2158</span></span></a> Passion is a force which may be wasted in vagrant, wild
excess, but which may also be used to give force and energy
to virtue. To avoid drunkenness, a man need not spill the
wine; he may temper its strength. A controlled anger is
the spur of courage. Passion in effect is the raw material
which is moulded by reason into the forms of practical virtue,
and the guiding principle in the process is the law of the
mean between excess and defect of passion.<a id="noteref_2159" name="noteref_2159" href="#note_2159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2159</span></span></a> This is, of
course, borrowed from Aristotle, and along with it the theory of
education by habit, which to Plato had seemed a popular and
inferior conception of the formation of the virtuous character.<a id="noteref_2160" name="noteref_2160" href="#note_2160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2160</span></span></a>
By the strong pressure of an enlightened will, the wild insurgent
forces of the lower nature are brought into conformity to a
higher law. It is a slow, laborious process, demanding infinite
patience, daily and hourly watchfulness, self-examination, frank
confession of faults to some friend or wise director of souls.<a id="noteref_2161" name="noteref_2161" href="#note_2161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2161</span></span></a>
It needs the minutest attention to the details of conduct and
circumstance, and a steady front against discouragement from
the backsliding of the wavering will.<a id="noteref_2162" name="noteref_2162" href="#note_2162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2162</span></span></a> In such a system the
hope of reform lies not in any sudden revolution. Plutarch has
no faith in instant conversion, reversing in a moment the ingrained
tendencies of years, and setting a man on a lofty height
of perfection, with no fear of falling away. That vain dream
of the older Stoicism, which recognised no degrees in virtuous
progress, made virtue an unapproachable ideal, and paralysed
struggling effort. It was not for an age stricken or blest with
a growing sense of moral weakness, and clutching eagerly at
any spiritual stay. Plutarch loves rather to think of character
under the image of a holy and royal building whose
founda<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tions are laid in gold, and each stone has to be chosen and
carefully fitted to the line of reason.<a id="noteref_2163" name="noteref_2163" href="#note_2163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2163</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch also accepted from the Peripatetic school the
principle, which Seneca was in the end compelled to admit,
that the finest paragon of wisdom and virtue is not quite
self-sufficing, that virtuous activity needs material to work
upon,<a id="noteref_2164" name="noteref_2164" href="#note_2164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2164</span></span></a> and that the good things of the world, in their proper
place, are as necessary to the moral musician as the flute to
the flute-player. Above all, Plutarch, with such a theory of
character, was bound to assert the cardinal doctrine of human
freedom. He had a profound faith in a threefold Providence,
exercised by the remote Supreme Deity, by the inferior
heavenly powers, and by the daemons.<a id="noteref_2165" name="noteref_2165" href="#note_2165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2165</span></span></a> But Providence is a
beneficent influence, not a crushing force of necessity. To
Plutarch fatalism is the blight of moral effort. Foreknowledge
and Fate are not conterminous and coextensive. Although
everything is foreseen by heavenly powers, not everything
is foreordained.<a id="noteref_2166" name="noteref_2166" href="#note_2166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2166</span></span></a> The law of Fate, like the laws of
earthly jurisprudence, deals with the universal, and only

follow necessarily from certain acts, but the acts are not

of life, neither trusting to chance nor cowed by any fancied
omnipotence of destiny, uses the will and reason to master
the materials out of which happiness is forged. Thus the
hope of a noble life is securely fenced in the fortress of the
autonomous will. To the Stoic the vicious man was a
fool, whose reason was hopelessly besotted. The Platonist
cherished the better hope, that reason, though darkened for a
time and vanquished by the forces of sense, could never
assent to sin, that there still remained in every human
soul a witness to the eternal law of conduct.

With such a faith as this, an earnest man like Plutarch
was bound to become a preacher of righteousness and a
spiritual director. Many of his moral treatises are the
expanded record of private counsel or the more formal
instruction of the lecture-hall. He had disciples all over the
Roman world, at Rome, Chaeronea, Ephesus, and Athens.<a id="noteref_2169" name="noteref_2169" href="#note_2169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2169</span></span></a> His

themes was a more solemn affair than the showy declamation
of the sophist, whose chief object was to dazzle and astonish
his audience by a display of rhetorical legerdemain on the
most trivial or out-worn themes. But the moral preacher in
those days, it is to be feared, often forgot the seriousness of
his mission, and degraded it by personal vanity and a tinsel
rhetoric to win a cheap applause.<a id="noteref_2171" name="noteref_2171" href="#note_2171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2171</span></span></a> The sophist and the
philosopher were in fact too often undistinguishable, and the
philosophic class-room often resounded with new-fangled
expressions of admiration. For all this Plutarch has an
indignant contempt. It is the prostitution of a noble mission.
It is turning the school into a theatre, and the reformer of
souls into a flatterer of the ear. To ask rhetoric from the
true philosopher is as if one should require a medicine
to be served in the finest Attic ware.<a id="noteref_2172" name="noteref_2172" href="#note_2172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2172</span></span></a> The profession of
philosophy becomes in Plutarch’s eyes a real priesthood for
the salvation of souls. He disapproves of the habit, which
prevailed in the sophist’s lecture theatre, of proposing subtle
or frivolous questions to the lecturer in order to make a display
of cleverness. But he would have those in moral difficulty to
remain after the sermon, for such it was, and lay bare their
faults and spiritual troubles.<a id="noteref_2173" name="noteref_2173" href="#note_2173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2173</span></span></a> He watched the moral progress

Plutarch evidently practised his remedies on himself. His
great gallery of the heroes of the past was primarily intended
to profit others. But he found, as the work went on, that he
was himself <span class="tei tei-q">“much profited by looking into these histories, as

Plutarch, as we have seen, waged determined war with the
older Stoic and Epicurean systems; yet his practical teaching
is coloured by the spirit of both. This is perhaps best seen in
the tract on Tranquillity, which might almost have been written
by Seneca. Although Plutarch elsewhere holds the Peripatetic
doctrine that the full life of virtue cannot dispense with the
external gifts of fortune, he asserts as powerfully as any Stoic
that life takes its predominant colour from the character, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“the kingdom of Heaven is within,”</span> that no change of external
fortune can calm the tumults of the soul. You seem to be
listening to a Stoic doctor when you hear that most calamities
draw their weight and bitterness from imagination, that excessive
desire for a thing engenders the fear of losing it, and
makes enjoyment feeble and uncertain, that men, by forgetting
the past in the vanishing present, lose the continuity of their
lives.<a id="noteref_2177" name="noteref_2177" href="#note_2177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2177</span></span></a> Is it Plutarch himself, or some Christian preacher, who

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lot by grateful content, who is not vexed by another’s splendid

The discipline by which this wise mood, which contains the
wisdom of all the ages, is to be attained is expounded by Plutarch

the vulgar objects of desire.<a id="noteref_2180" name="noteref_2180" href="#note_2180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2180</span></span></a> Yet moral growth must be slow,

growth in virtue; he will shrink from the arrogance of the

Plutarch expounded the gospel of a cheerful and contented
life, and he evidently practised what he preached. Yet, like
all finely strung spirits, he had his hours when the pathos of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life was heavy upon him, and death seemed the sovereign
remedy for it all. Any one who shares the vulgar notion
that the Greeks, even of the great age, were a race living in
perpetual sunshine and careless enjoyment of the hour, should
read the Consolation to Apollonius on the death of his son. He
will there find all the great poets, from Homer downwards, cited
in support of the most pessimist view of human life.<a id="noteref_2185" name="noteref_2185" href="#note_2185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2185</span></span></a> In the field

We are now on the threshold of another world, from which
many voices were coming to the age of Plutarch. After
philosophy has done its utmost to mould the life of sixty or
seventy years into a moral harmony, with its music in itself,<a id="noteref_2191" name="noteref_2191" href="#note_2191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2191</span></span></a>
the effort ends in a melancholy doubt. The precept of Seneca
and Plutarch, that you should live under the tutelary eye of
some patron sage of the past, revealed a need of exterior help
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for the virtuous will. The passion for continued existence was
sobered by the sense of continued moral responsibility and the
shadow of a judgment to come. Vistas of a supernatural world
opened above the struggling human life on earth and in far
mysterious distances beyond. When philosophy had done its
utmost to heal the diseases of humanity, it was confronted with
another task, to give man a true knowledge of God and assurance
of His help in this world and the next. Philosophy had
for ages held before the eyes of men a dim vision of Him, sublime,
remote, ineffable. But it was a vision for the few, not for the
many. It was rather metaphysical than moral and spiritual.
It paid little heed to the myths and mysteries by which
humanity had been seeking to solve its spiritual enigmas.
This long travail of humanity could not be ignored by a true
religious philosophy. Some means must be found to reconcile
ancient religious imagination with the best conception of the
Divine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The problem indeed was not a new one, except in the sense
that an intense revival of religious faith or superstition
demanded a fresh théodicée. As early as the sixth century
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, the simple faith in legend had been shaken among the
higher minds in a great philosophic movement which extended
over many ages. Some had rejected the myths with scorn.
Others had proceeded by the method of more or less critical
selection. Others, again, strove to find in them a historical
kernel, or an esoteric meaning veiled in allegory. The same
methods reappeared in the age of Varro and Scaevola,<a id="noteref_2192" name="noteref_2192" href="#note_2192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2192</span></span></a> and,
five centuries later, in the theology of Macrobius.<a id="noteref_2193" name="noteref_2193" href="#note_2193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2193</span></span></a> The effort,
however, of the Platonists of the second century has a peculiar
interest, because some fresh elements have been added to the
great problem since the days of Xenophanes and Euhemerus
and Varro.

To Plutarch, theology is the crown of all philosophy.<a id="noteref_2194" name="noteref_2194" href="#note_2194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2194</span></span></a> To
form true and worthy conceptions of the Divine Being is not
less important than to pay Him pious worship. Plutarch’s
lofty conception of the Infinite and Supreme, like that of
Maximus of Tyre, dominates all his system. In a curious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>treatise on Isis and Osiris, he reviews many a device of scholastic
subtlety, many a crude guess of embryonic science, many a dream
of Pythagorean mysticism, to find an inner meaning in the
Egyptian myth. Yet it embalms, in all this frigid scholasticism,
the highest and purest expression of Plutarch’s idea of the
Supreme. In the end he breaks away from all lower mundane
conceptions of the Divine, and reveals a glimpse of the beatific
vision. <span class="tei tei-q">“While we are here below,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“encumbered by
bodily affections, we can have no intercourse with God, save as
in philosophic thought we may faintly touch Him, as in a dream.
But when our souls are released, and have passed into the region
of the pure, invisible, and changeless, this God will be their
guide and king who depend on Him and gaze with insatiable
longing on the beauty which may not be spoken of by the lips of
man.”</span><a id="noteref_2195" name="noteref_2195" href="#note_2195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2195</span></span></a> To Plutarch God is the One, Supreme, Eternal Being,
removed to an infinite distance from the mutable and mortal—the
Being of whom we can only predicate that <span class="tei tei-q">“He is,”</span> who lives
in an everlasting <span class="tei tei-q">“now,”</span> of whom it would be irrational and
impious to speak in the terms of the future or the past.<a id="noteref_2196" name="noteref_2196" href="#note_2196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2196</span></span></a> He
is the One, the Absolute of Eleatic or Pythagorean philosophy,
the Demiurgus of Plato, the primal motive power of Aristotle,
the World-Soul of the Stoics. Yet Plutarch is as far removed
from the Epicureanism which banishes God from the universe
as he is from the pantheism of east or west, which interfuses
the world and God.<a id="noteref_2197" name="noteref_2197" href="#note_2197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2197</span></span></a> Plutarch never abandons the Divine
personality, in whatever sense he may hold it. God is the
highest perfection of goodness and intelligence, the Creator, the
watchful and benevolent Providence of the world, the Author
of all good. His power, indeed, is not unlimited. There is a
power of evil in the world which must be recognised. And,
as good cannot be the author of evil, the origin of evil must
be sought in a separate and original principle, distinct from,
but not co-equal with, God: a principle recognised in many a
theology and philosophy of east and west, and called by many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>names—Ahriman or Hades, the <span class="tei tei-q">“dyad”</span> of Pythagoras, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“strife”</span> of Empedocles, the <span class="tei tei-q">“other”</span> of Plato.<a id="noteref_2198" name="noteref_2198" href="#note_2198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2198</span></span></a> Its seat is the
World-Soul, which has a place alongside of God and Matter,
causing all that is deadly in nature, all moral disorder in the
soul of man. Matter is the seat both of evil and good.<a id="noteref_2199" name="noteref_2199" href="#note_2199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2199</span></span></a> In
its lower regions it may seem to be wholly mastered by the
evil principle; yet in its essence it is really struggling towards
the good, and, as a female principle, susceptible to the formative
influence of the Divine, as well as exposed to the incursions of
evil. Plutarch’s theory of creation is, in the main, that of
the Timaeus, with mingled elements of Stoic cosmogony.
Through number and harmony the Divine Mind introduces
order into the mass of lawless chaos. But while God stands
outside the cosmos as its creator, He is not merely the divine
craftsman, but a penetrating power. For from Him proceeds
the soul which is interfused with the world and which sustains
it. Through the World-Soul, God is in touch with all powers
and provinces of the universe. Yet throughout the universe,
as in the human soul, there are always present the two elements
side by side, the principles of reason and unreason, of evil and
of good.<a id="noteref_2200" name="noteref_2200" href="#note_2200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2200</span></span></a>

The vision of the one eternal, passionless Spirit, far removed
from the world of chance and change and earthly soilure, was
the conquest of Greek philosophy, travailing for 800 years.
But it was a vision far withdrawn; it was separated by an
apparently impassable gulf alike from the dreams of Hellenic
legend and from the struggling life of humanity. The poets,
and even the poet of divinest inspiration, had bequeathed a mass
of legend, often shocking to the later moral sense, yet always
seductive by its imaginative charm. How to reconcile the
fictions of poetry, which had so long enthralled all imaginations,
with higher spiritual intuitions, that was the problem. It was
not indeed a new problem. It had driven Xenophanes into open
revolt, it had exercised the mind of the reverent Pindar and
the sceptical Euripides. It had suggested to Plato the necessity
of recasting myth in the light of the Divine purity.<a id="noteref_2201" name="noteref_2201" href="#note_2201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2201</span></span></a> But the

more than a theological or philosophic, movement; and the
glory of Greek literature was inseparably linked with the glory
and the shame of Greek mythology. To discard and repudiate
the myths was to give the lie to the divine poets. To explain
them away by physical allegory, in the fashion of the
Stoic theology, or to lower the <span class="tei tei-q">“blessed ones”</span> of Olympus
to the stature of earthly kings and warriors, after the manner
of Euhemerus, was to break the charm of poetic legend, and
violate the instincts of ancestral piety.<a id="noteref_2202" name="noteref_2202" href="#note_2202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2202</span></span></a> And there were many
other claimants for devotion beside the ancient gods of Rome
and Greece. Persia and Phrygia, Commagene and Egypt, every

shores of the Indian Ocean.<a id="noteref_2203" name="noteref_2203" href="#note_2203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2203</span></span></a> How could a man trained in the

On the other hand, from whatever quarter, a new spiritual
vision had opened, strange to the ancient world. It is not merely
that the conception of God has become more pure and lofty;
the whole attitude of the higher minds to the Eternal had altered.
A great spiritual revolution had concurred with a great political
revolution. The vision of the divine world which satisfied men
in the age of Pericles or in the Punic wars, when religion,
politics, and morality were linked in unbroken harmony, when,
if spiritual vision was bounded, spiritual needs were less
clamorous, and the moral life less troubled and self-conscious,
could no longer appease the yearnings of the higher minds. Both
morality and religion had become less formal and external, more
penetrating and exigent. Prayer was no longer a formal litany
for worldly blessings or sinful indulgence, but a colloquy with
God, in a moment of spiritual exaltation.<a id="noteref_2204" name="noteref_2204" href="#note_2204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2204</span></span></a> The true sacrifice
was no longer <span class="tei tei-q">“the blood of bulls,”</span> but a quiet spirit. Along

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>purification and spiritual support. The old mysteries and the
new cults from the East had fostered a longing for sacramental
peace and assurance of another life, in which the crooked should
be made straight and the perverted be restored.

in the slumber of this mortal life, the pure spirit is sometimes
visited by visions coming through the gate of horn,<a id="noteref_2207" name="noteref_2207" href="#note_2207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2207</span></span></a> visions
of another world seen in some former time. And, following
them, the moral hero, like Heracles, the model of strenuous
virtue, through toil and tribulation may gain the crown.
On this stormy sea of time, philosophy gives us the veil of
Leucothea to charm the troubled waters. It is true that only
when release comes at death, does the soul attain to the full vision
of God. For the Highest is separated from us by a great gulf.
Yet the analysis of the soul which Maximus partly borrows from
Aristotle, discovers His seat in us, the highest reason, that power
of intuitive, all-embracing, instantaneous vision, which is distinct
from the slower and tentative operations of the understanding.
It is by this higher faculty that God is seen, so far as He may
be, in this mixed and imperfect state.<a id="noteref_2208" name="noteref_2208" href="#note_2208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2208</span></span></a> For the vision of God

How could a Platonist of the second century, we may ask,
holding such a spiritual creed, reconcile himself to Greek
mythology, nay, to all the mythologies, with all the selfish grossness
of their ritual? Plutarch and Maximus of Tyre answer
the question by a piously ingenious interpretation of ancient
legend, and partly by a system of daemons, of mediating and
ministering spirits, who fill the interval between the changeless
Infinite and the region of sin and change.

In religion, they say, in effect, we must take human nature
as we find it. We are not legislating for a young race, just
springing from the earth, but for races with conceptions of
the Divine which run back through countless ages. There may
be, here and there, an elect few who can raise their minds, in
rare moments, to the pure vision of the Eternal. But heaven is so
far from earth, and earth is so darkened by the mists of sense,
that temple and image and sacred litany, and the myths created
by the genius of poets, or imposed by lawgivers, are needed to
sustain and give expression to the vague impotent yearnings of
the mass of men.<a id="noteref_2212" name="noteref_2212" href="#note_2212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2212</span></span></a> The higher intuitions of religion must be
translated into material symbolism; <span class="tei tei-q">“here we see, as through

as the many tribes of men. Some, like the Egyptian worship
of animals, are of a degraded type. The Greek anthropomorphism,
although falling far short of the grandeur and purity of
the Infinite, yet furnishes its noblest image, because it has glorified
by artistic genius the human body, which has been chosen as
the earthly home of the rational soul.<a id="noteref_2213" name="noteref_2213" href="#note_2213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2213</span></span></a> And the cause of myth

They are different methods of teaching religious truth, adapted
to different stages of intellectual development. Myth is the
poetic philosophy of a simple age, for whose ears the mystic
truth must be sweetened by music, an age whose eyes cannot
bear to gaze on the Divine splendour unveiled.<a id="noteref_2214" name="noteref_2214" href="#note_2214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2214</span></span></a> Philosophic
theology is for an age of rationalism and inquiry; it would have
been unintelligible to the simple imaginative childhood of the
race. Maximus has the same faith as Plutarch that the
mythopoeic age possessed, along with an enthralling artistic
skill, all the speculative depth and subtlety of later ages. It
is almost a profanity to imagine that Homer or Hesiod or
Pindar were less of philosophers than Aristotle or Chrysippus.<a id="noteref_2215" name="noteref_2215" href="#note_2215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2215</span></span></a>
It was assumed that the early myth-makers and lawgivers
possessed a sacred lore of immense value and undoubted truth,
which they dimly shadowed forth in symbolism of fanciful
tale or allegory.<a id="noteref_2216" name="noteref_2216" href="#note_2216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2216</span></span></a> The myth at once hides and reveals the
mystery of the Divine. If a man comes to its interpretation
with the proper discipline and acumen, the kernel of spiritual
or physical meaning which is reverently veiled from the profane
eye will disclose itself. And thus the later philosophic
theologian is not reading his own higher thoughts of God into
the grotesque fancies of a remote antiquity; he is evolving
and interpreting a wisdom more original than his own. In
this process of rediscovering a lost tradition, he pushes aside
the mass of erroneous interpretations which have perverted
the original doctrine, by literal acceptance of what is really
figurative, by abuse of names and neglect of realities, by
stopping at the symbol instead of rising to the divine fact.<a id="noteref_2217" name="noteref_2217" href="#note_2217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2217</span></span></a>

The treatise of Plutarch on Isis and Osiris is the best
illustration of this attitude to myth. Plutarch’s theology,
though primarily Hellenic, does not confine its gaze to the
Greek Olympus; it is intended to be the science of human
religion in general. It gives formal expression to the growing
tendency to syncretism. The central truth of it is, that as
the sun and moon, under many different names, shed their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>light on all, so the gods are variously invoked and honoured

and Providence common to all. And the lower deities of
different countries may often be identified by the theologian,
under all varieties of title and attribute. So, to Plutarch as
to Herodotus, the immemorial worships of Egypt were the
prototypes or the counterparts of the cults of Greece.<a id="noteref_2219" name="noteref_2219" href="#note_2219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2219</span></span></a> There
was a temple of Osiris at Delphi, and Clea, to whom Plutarch’s
treatise is addressed, was not only a hereditary priestess of the
Egyptian god, but held a leading place among the female
ministers of Dionysus.<a id="noteref_2220" name="noteref_2220" href="#note_2220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2220</span></span></a> It was fitting that a person so
catholic in her sympathies should have dedicated to her the
treatise in which Plutarch expounds his all-embracing theology.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this treatise we see the new theology wrestling in a
hopeless struggle to unite the thought of Pythagoras and
Plato with the grossness of Egyptian myth. It is a striking,
but not a solitary, example of the misapplication of dialectic
skill and learning, to find the thoughts of the present in the
fancies of the past, and from a mistaken piety, to ignore the
onward march of humanity. Arbitrary interpretations of
myth, alike unhistorical and unscientific, make us wonder how
they could ever have occurred to men of intellect and learning.
Yet the explanation is not far to seek. More elevated conceptions
of God, the purged and clarified religious intuition,
do not readily find a substitute for the old symbolism to
express their visions. Religion, beyond any other institution,
depends for its power on antiquity, on the charm of ancestral
pieties. A religious symbol is doubly sacred when it has ministered
to the devotion of many generations.

he also wished, in discussing a worship so multiform as that
of Isis, to develop his attitude to myth in general. We
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cannot follow him minutely in his survey of the various

The daemonology of the Platonists of the second century
had its roots deep in the Hellenic past, as it was destined to
have a long future. But it was specially evoked by the needs
of the pagan revival of the Antonine age. The doctrine had
assumed many forms in previous Greek thought from the days
of Hesiod, and it has various aspects, and serves various
purposes, in the hands of Plutarch, Apuleius, and Maximus of
Tyre. It was in the first place an apologetic for heathenism
in an age distracted between a lofty conception of one infinite
Father and legends of many lands and many ages, which were
consecrated by long tradition, yet often shocking to the spiritual
sense. As the conception of God became purer and seemed to
withdraw into remoter distances, souls like Apuleius, wedded
to the ancient rites, found in the daemons, ranging between
earth and ether, the means of conveying answers to prayer, of
inspiring dreams and prophecy, of ordering all the machinery
of divination.<a id="noteref_2224" name="noteref_2224" href="#note_2224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2224</span></span></a> To others, such as Maximus of Tyre, the
doctrine seemed to discover a spiritual support for human
frailty, guardians in temptation and the crises of life, mediators
between the human spirit, immured for a time in the prison
of the flesh, and the remote purity of the Supreme.<a id="noteref_2225" name="noteref_2225" href="#note_2225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2225</span></span></a> To other
minds the daemon is no external power, but dwelling within
each soul, as its divine part, a kind of ideal personality,<a id="noteref_2226" name="noteref_2226" href="#note_2226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2226</span></span></a> in
following whose ghostly promptings lies the secret of happiness.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Finally, the doctrine created an eschatology by which vistas
of moral perfection were opened before purer spirits in worlds
to come, and the infinite responsibilities of this life were
terribly enforced by threats of endless degradation.<a id="noteref_2227" name="noteref_2227" href="#note_2227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2227</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The daemons who came to the aid of mythology
in the Antonine age, were composite beings, with a double
nature corresponding to the two worlds of the Divine and
human which they linked together. They are at once divine
in power and knowledge, and akin to humanity in feeling and
passion.<a id="noteref_2228" name="noteref_2228" href="#note_2228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2228</span></span></a> They are even liable to mortality, as was proved by
the famous tale of the voice which floated to the Egyptian
pilot from the Echinad isles, announcing that the great Pan
was dead.<a id="noteref_2229" name="noteref_2229" href="#note_2229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2229</span></span></a> Their sphere is the middle space between the lofty
ether and the mists of earth. This spiritual mediation, as
Maximus points out, is not an exceptional principle. There is a
chain of being in the universe, as it had been developed in the
cosmic theory of Aristotle, by which the remote extremes are
linked in successive stages, and may be blended or reconciled,
in a mean or compound, as in a musical harmony. The
principle is seen operating in the relation of the great physical
elements. Thus, for example, fire and water are at opposite
poles: they cannot pass immediately into one another, but air
furnishes a medium between the two, and reconciles their
opposition by participating in the warmth of the one element
and in the moisture of the other.<a id="noteref_2230" name="noteref_2230" href="#note_2230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2230</span></span></a> The suggestions of cosmic
theory seemed to receive support from many tales which, in
that age of luxuriant superstition, were accepted even in
educated circles. Travellers, returning from Britain, told
weird stories of desolate islands in the northern seas which
were the haunts of genii.<a id="noteref_2231" name="noteref_2231" href="#note_2231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2231</span></span></a> A Spartan visitor to Delphi related
how, on the shores of the Indian Ocean, he had met with a
hermit of a beautiful countenance and proof against all disease,
who spoke with many tongues, and derived his mystic powers
from intercourse with the spirits which haunted those distant
solitudes.<a id="noteref_2232" name="noteref_2232" href="#note_2232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2232</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch also justifies his theory of daemons by an appeal
to the authority of Hesiod, of Pythagoras and Plato, Xenocrates
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Chrysippus.<a id="noteref_2233" name="noteref_2233" href="#note_2233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2233</span></span></a> He might have added others to the list.
For, indeed, the conception of these mediators between the
ethereal world and the world of sense has a long history—too
long to be developed within our present limits. Its earliest
appearance in Greece was in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Works and Days</span></span> of Hesiod, who
first definitely sketched a great scale of being—gods, heroes,
daemons, and mortal men. Hesiod’s daemons are the men of
the golden age, translated to a blissful and immortal life, yet
linked in sympathy with those still on earth—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ministers of
good and guardians of men.”</span><a id="noteref_2234" name="noteref_2234" href="#note_2234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2234</span></span></a> The conception was introduced
at a time when new moral and spiritual forces were at work,
which were destined to have a profound and lasting influence
on paganism for a thousand years. The glamour of the radiant
Olympus and the glory of heroic battle were fading. Men were
settling down to humdrum toil, and becoming acutely conscious
of the troubles and sadness of life. With a craving for
support and comfort which the religion of Homer could not
give, the pessimist view of life, which colours Hesiod’s poetry,
sought consolation in a mysticism altogether strange to Homer,
and even to Hesiod. The feeling that humanity had declined
from a glorious prime and, in its weakness and terror at death,
needed some new consolations, was met by a system which,
although Orpheus may never have existed, will always be
called by his name.<a id="noteref_2235" name="noteref_2235" href="#note_2235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2235</span></span></a> The Chthonian deities, Dionysus and
Demeter, sprang into a prominence which they had not in
Homer. The immortal life began to overshadow the present,
and in the mysteries men found some assurance of immortality,
and preparation for it by cleansing from the stains of time.
That idea, which was to have such profound influence upon
later thought, that there is a divine element in man, which is
emancipated from the prison of the flesh at death, became an
accepted doctrine. At the same time, the faith in helpers and
mediators, half human, half divine, lent itself to the support
of human weakness. The heroic soul who passed victoriously
through the ordeal of this life, might in another world become
the guardian and exemplar of those who were still on earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Ionian and Eleatic schools the doctrine was held
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in some sense by all the great thinkers, by Thales, Anaximander,
Heraclitus, Xenophanes. To Thales the world was
full of daemons.<a id="noteref_2236" name="noteref_2236" href="#note_2236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2236</span></span></a> In the mystic teaching of Heraclitus the
universe teems with such spirits, for in the perpetual flux and
change, the divine is constantly passing into the death of
mortal life and the mortal into the divine.<a id="noteref_2237" name="noteref_2237" href="#note_2237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2237</span></span></a> Empedocles, in
conformity with his cosmic dualism, first made the distinction
between good and bad daemons, and followed Pythagoras in
connecting daemonic theory with the doctrine of a fall from
divine estate, and long exile and incarnation in animal forms.<a id="noteref_2238" name="noteref_2238" href="#note_2238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2238</span></span></a>
It was in the dim system of Pythagoras that the doctrine
became a really religious tenet, as it was to the Platonists of
the Antonine age. Pythagoras was more priest and mystic
than philosopher. He had far more in common with the
Orphici, with Abaris and Epimenides, than with Thales or
Anaximander. His school, for we can hardly speak of himself,
connected the doctrine of daemons with the doctrines of metempsychosis
and purification and atonement in another world.
Souls released from the prison-house of the flesh are submitted
to a purgatorial cleansing of a thousand years. Some pass the
ordeal victoriously, and ascend to higher spheres. Others are
kept in chains by the Erinnyes. The beatified souls become
daemons or good spirits, ranging over the universe, and
manifesting themselves in dreams and omens and ghostly
monitions, sometimes becoming even visible to the eye.<a id="noteref_2239" name="noteref_2239" href="#note_2239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2239</span></span></a> But
their highest function is to guide men in the path of virtue
during life, and after death to purify the disembodied spirit,
which may become a daemon in its turn. This is the theory,
which, with some modifications, was adopted by the later
Platonists. It was popularised by Pindar, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Homer of the
Pythagorean school.”</span> He was captivated by its doctrine of
the migrations of the soul, of its ordeal in a future life, and
its chastisement or elevation to lofty spiritual rank as daemon
or hero. In the second Olympian ode, the punishment of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wicked and the beatitude of noble spirits, in the company
of Peleus and Achilles in the happy isles, are painted in all
the glowing imagery of the Apocalypse.<a id="noteref_2240" name="noteref_2240" href="#note_2240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2240</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The daemonology of Pythagoras, along with the doctrine
of metempsychosis in its moral aspect, was adopted by Plato,
whether as a serious theory or as a philosophic myth. The
chief passages in Plato where the daemons are mentioned are
suffused with such mythic colour that it would perhaps be rash
to extract from them any sharp dogmatic theory.<a id="noteref_2241" name="noteref_2241" href="#note_2241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2241</span></span></a> But Plato,
holding firmly the remote purity of God, strove to fill the
interval between the mortal and the Infinite by a graded scheme
of superhuman beings. The daemon is a compound of the
mortal and the divine, spanning the chasm between them. This
is the power which conveys to God the prayers and sacrifices of
men, and brings to men the commands and rewards of the gods,
which operates in prophecy, sacrifice, and mystery. And again
the daemon is a power which is assigned to each soul at birth,
and which at death conducts it to the eternal world, to receive
judgment for its deeds, and perhaps to be condemned to return
once more to earth. The reason in man, his truly divine part,
is also called his daemon, his good genius. It is the power
whose kindred is with the world of the unseen, which is immortal,
and capable of a lofty destiny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like his master Plato, Maximus of Tyre seems to know
nothing of the evil daemons, who, as we shall presently see,
were used by Plutarch to account for the immorality of myth.
To Maximus the daemons are rather angelic ministers, sent
forth to advise and succour weak mortal men.<a id="noteref_2242" name="noteref_2242" href="#note_2242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2242</span></span></a> They are
the necessary mediators between the one Supreme and our
frail mortal life. Dwelling in a region between earth and ether,
they are of mingled mortal and divine nature, weaker than the
gods, stronger than men, servants of God and overseers of men,
by kinship with either linking the weakness of the mortal with
the Divine. Great is the multitude of this heavenly host,
interpreters between God and man: <span class="tei tei-q">“thrice ten thousand are
they upon the fruitful earth, immortal, ministers of Zeus,”</span>
healers of the sick, revealers of what is dark, aiding the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>craftsman, companions of the wayfarer. On land and sea, in
the city and the field, they are ever with us. They inspired a
Socrates, a Pythagoras, a Diogenes, or a Zeno; they are present
in all human spirits. Only the lost and hopeless soul is
without the guardianship of such an unearthly friend.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earlier Platonist or Pythagorean daemonology was not
employed to explain or rehabilitate polytheism. Although
Plato would not banish myth from his Utopia, he placed his
ban on the mythopoeic poets who had lent their authority to
tales and crimes and passions of the gods. Myth could only
be tolerated in the education of the young if it conformed
to the standard of Divine perfection.<a id="noteref_2243" name="noteref_2243" href="#note_2243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2243</span></span></a> God cannot be the
author of evil, evil is the offspring of matter; it is a
limitation or an incident of the fleeting world of sense. It is
only relative and transitory, and can never penetrate the realm
of the ideal. But to Plutarch evil was an ultimate principle
in the universe, ever present along with the good, although
not perhaps of equal range and power.<a id="noteref_2244" name="noteref_2244" href="#note_2244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2244</span></span></a> And Plutarch would
not banish and disown the poets for attributing to the gods
passions and crimes which would have been dishonouring to
humanity. He would not abandon the ancient ritual because
it contained elements of gloom and impurity which shocked
a refined moral sense. Mythology and ritual, as they had been
moulded by poets or imposed by lawgivers, were intertwined
with the whole life of the people and formed an essential
element in the glory of Hellenic genius. The piety and
aesthetic feeling of the priest of Delphi still clung to ancient
ritual and legend, even when the lofty morality of the Platonist
was offended by the grossness which mingled with their artistic
charm. Might it not be possible to moralise the pagan system
without discrediting its authors, to reconcile the claims of
reason and conservative religious feeling? Might it not be
possible to save at once the purity and majesty of God and the
inspiration of the poets?

To Plutarch the doctrine of daemons seemed to furnish an
answer to this question; it also satisfied other spiritual cravings
which were equally urgent. The need of some mixed nature
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to mediate between the ethereal world and the region of
sense became all the more imperious as the philosophic conception
of God receded into a more remote and majestic purity.
The gradation of spiritual powers, which had been accepted by
so many great minds from the time of Hesiod, at once guarded
the aloofness of the Supreme and satisfied the craving of the
religious instinct for some means of contact with it, for divine
help in the trials of time. These mediating spirits were also
made in Plutarch’s theology to furnish an explanation of
oracles and all forms of prophecy, of the inspired enthusiasm
of artist, sage, and poet. Finally, the theory, with the aid of
mythic fancy, cast a light on the fate of souls beyond the
grave, and vindicated the Divine justice by a vision of a judgment
to come.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch’s daemonology, as he admits himself, is an inheritance
from the past. The daemons are beings half divine, half
human; they are godlike in power and intelligence, they
are human in liability to the passions engendered by the flesh.
This host of spirits dwell in the borderland below the moon,
between the pure changeless region of the celestial powers and
the region of the mutable and the mortal. Linking the two
worlds together by their composite nature, the daemons differ in
degrees of virtue; some are more akin to the Divine perfection,
others more tainted by the evil of the lower world.<a id="noteref_2245" name="noteref_2245" href="#note_2245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2245</span></span></a> The good
spirits, as they are described by Maximus of Tyre, are true
servants of God and faithful guardians of human virtue. But
the bad daemons assume a special prominence in the theology
of Plutarch. Nor was the development unnatural. His
conception of immortality, and the necessity of purification in
another world, raised the question as to the destiny of souls
whose stains were indelible. If purified souls are charged as
daemons with offices of mercy, may not the impure prolong their
guilt in plaguing and corrupting mankind? May not the existence
of such sombre spirits account for the evil in the world, the
existence of which cannot be blinked? Although there are traces
of this moral dualism long before Plutarch’s time, both in Greek
poetry and speculation, it was Xenocrates who first formulated
the doctrine of evil daemons in relation to mythology.<a id="noteref_2246" name="noteref_2246" href="#note_2246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2246</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“It
can<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not be,”</span> he taught, <span class="tei tei-q">“that unlucky days and festivals, conducted
with scourgings and fasts, lamentations and lacerations and
impure words and deeds, are celebrated in honour of the blessed
gods or good daemons. They are rather offered to those
powerful and terrible spirits of evil in the air whose sombre
character is propitiated by such gloomy rites.”</span> These
sinister spirits assert their vast power, and display their
malevolence, not only in plague, pestilence, and dearth, and all
the desolating convulsions of the physical world, but in the
moral perversion and deception of the human race. They are
accountable for all that shocks the moral sense in the impure
or ghastly tales which the poets have told of the gods,
and in the gloomy or obscene rites which are celebrated
in their honour. The poets and early myth-makers have not
invented the evil in myth and rite; they have been deceived
as to the authors of the evil. Each of the blessed gods has
attached to him a daemon who is in some respects his counterpart,
wielding his power, but who may perpetrate every kind of
moral enormity in his name, and who demands to be honoured
and propitiated after his own evil nature. The bad daemons,
in fact, masquerade as gods and bring disgrace upon them. It
was not the Blessed Ones who mutilated a father, who raised
rebellion in Olympus and were driven into exile, who stooped to
be the lovers of mortal women. These are the works of spirits
of evil, using their fiendish cunning to deceive a simple
age. Its poetry was seduced to cast a magical charm over
their lusts and crimes; its superstition was terrified into
appeasing the fiends by shameful orgies or dark bloody rites.
Poets and founders of ritual have been faithful to supernatural
fact, but they did not see that in the supernatural order there are
evil powers as well as good. They are sound in their record
but wrong in their interpretation. In this fashion Plutarch
and his school strove to reconcile a rational faith with the
grossness of superstition, to save the holiness of God and the
glory of Homer.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the bad daemons who were called in to save the
ancient cults proved dangerous allies in the end. Few who
really know him will be inclined to question the sincere monotheistic
piety of Plutarch. And a sympathetic critic will even
not withhold from him a certain respect for his old-world
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attachment to the forms of his ancestral worship. He knew
no other avenue of approaching the Divine. Yet only the
imperious religious cravings and the spiritual contradictions of
that age could excuse or account for a system which was
disastrous both to paganism and philosophy. The union of
gross superstition with ingenious theology, the licence of
subtlety applied to the ancient legends, demanded too much
credulity from the cultivated and too much subtlety from
the vulgar. It undermined the already crumbling polytheism;
it made philosophy the apostle of a belief in a baleful
daemonic agency. If a malign genius was seated beside every
god to account for the evil in nature or myth, might not a day
come when both friends and enemies would confound the
daemon and the god?<a id="noteref_2247" name="noteref_2247" href="#note_2247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2247</span></span></a> Might not philosophy be led on in a
disastrous decline to the justification of magic, incantations,
and all theurgic extravagance? That day did come in the
fourth century when Platonism and polytheism in close league
were making a last stand against the victorious Church. Even
then indeed a purer Platonism still survived, as well as a purer
paganism sustained by the mysteries of Mithra or Demeter.
But the paganism which the Christian empire found it hardest
to conquer, and which propagated itself far into the Christian
ages, was the belief in magic and occult powers founded on
the doctrine of daemons. And the Christian controversialist,
with as firm a faith in daemons as the pagan, turned that
doctrine against the faith which it was invented to support.
The distinction of good and bad daemons, first drawn by
Xenocrates and Chrysippus, and developed by Plutarch, was
eagerly seized upon by Tatian and S. Clement of Alexandria, by
Minucius Felix and S. Cyprian.<a id="noteref_2248" name="noteref_2248" href="#note_2248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2248</span></span></a> But the good became the
heavenly host of Christ and His angels; the bad were identified
with the pagan gods. What would have been the anguish of
Plutarch could he have foreseen that his theology, elaborated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with such pious subtlety and care, would one day be used
against the gracious powers of Olympus, and that the spirits
he had conjured up to defend them would be exorcised
as maleficent fiends by the triumphant dialectic of S.
Augustine.<a id="noteref_2249" name="noteref_2249" href="#note_2249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2249</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The daemonology of Plutarch also furnished a theory of
prophetic powers, and especially of the inspiration of Delphi.
It was in the porticoes of the shrine of Apollo, or among the
monuments of ancient glory and devotion, that the most interesting
of Plutarch’s religious essays were inspired. He probably
bore the honours of the Delphic priesthood down to the last days
of his long life. But in the years when Plutarch was ordering
a sacrifice or a procession, or discussing antiquarian and philosophic
questions with travellers from Britain or the eastern
seas, Delphi had lost much of its ancient power and renown.
Great political and great economic changes had reduced the
functions of the oracle to a comparatively humble sphere. It
was no longer consulted on affairs of state by great potentates
of the East and West. The farmers of Boeotia or the Arcadian
shepherds now came to seek the causes of failure in their
crops or of a murrain among their herds, to ask advice about
the purchase of a piece of land or the marriage of a child. So
far back as the days of Cicero the faith in oracles had been
greatly shaken,<a id="noteref_2250" name="noteref_2250" href="#note_2250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2250</span></span></a> and even the most venerable shrines were no
longer resorted to as of old. Powerful philosophic schools,
the Cynic and the Epicurean, poured contempt on all the arts
of divination. Many of the ancient oracles had long been
silent. In Boeotia, where, in the days of Herodotus, the air
was full of inspiration,<a id="noteref_2251" name="noteref_2251" href="#note_2251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2251</span></span></a> the ancient magic only lingered around
Lebadea. Sheep grazed around the fanes of Tegyra and the
Ptoan Apollo. While in old days at Delphi, the services of
two, and even three, Pythian priestesses were demanded by the
concourse of votaries, in Plutarch’s time one priestess sufficed.<a id="noteref_2252" name="noteref_2252" href="#note_2252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2252</span></span></a>
But the second century brought, along with a general religious
revival, a restoration of the ancient faith in oracles. The
voice of Delphi had been silenced for a time by Nero, and
the sacred chasm had been choked with corpses because the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>priestess had branded the emperor as another Orestes.<a id="noteref_2253" name="noteref_2253" href="#note_2253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2253</span></span></a> But the
oracle, although shorn of much of its glory, recovered some of
its popularity in the second century. It received offerings
once more from wealthy votaries. The emperor Hadrian
characteristically tested its omniscience by a question as to
the birthplace of Homer. Curious travellers from distant
lands, even philosophers of the Cynic and Epicurean schools,
came to visit the ancient shrine, to make the round of its
antiquarian treasures, and to discuss the secret of its inspiration.<a id="noteref_2254" name="noteref_2254" href="#note_2254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2254</span></span></a>
A new town sprang up at the gates of the sanctuary;
sumptuous temples, baths, and halls of assembly replaced the
solitude and ruins of many generations. The god himself
seemed to the pious Plutarch to have returned in power to his
ancient seat.<a id="noteref_2255" name="noteref_2255" href="#note_2255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2255</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The revival of Delphi gladdened the heart of Plutarch as
a sign of reviving religion and Hellenism. And although the
oracle no longer wielded an oecumenical primacy, its antiquities
and its claims to inspiration evidently attracted many curious
inquirers. We are admitted to their conversations in the
Delphic treatises of Plutarch. His characters bear the names
of the old-world schools, but there is a strangely modern tone
in their discussions. Sometimes we might fancy ourselves
listening to a debate on the inspiration of Scripture between
an agnostic, a Catholic, and an accommodating broad Churchman.
Plutarch himself, or his representative, generally holds
the balance between the extreme views, and tries to reconcile
the claims of reason and of faith. It is clear that even in
that age of religious revival there was no lack of a scepticism
like that of Lucian. Even in the sacred courts of Delphi the
Epicurean might be heard suggesting that, because, among a
thousand random prophecies of natural events, one here and
there may seem to tally with the fact, it does not follow that
the prediction was sure and true at the moment of deliverance;<a id="noteref_2256" name="noteref_2256" href="#note_2256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2256</span></span></a>
the wandering word may sometimes hit the mark. The
fulfilment is a mere coincidence, a happy chance. Boethus, the
sceptic, is easily refuted by the orthodox Serapion, who makes an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>appeal to well-known oracles which have been actually fulfilled,
not merely in a loose, apparent fashion, but down to the
minutest details of time, place, and manner.<a id="noteref_2257" name="noteref_2257" href="#note_2257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2257</span></span></a> In these discussions,
although the caviller is heard with a tolerant courtesy,
it is clear that faith is always in the ascendant. Yet even
faith has to face and account for an apparent degeneracy
which might well cause some uneasiness. For instance, is it
not startling that, in the name of the god of music, many oracles
should be delivered in trivial, badly-fashioned verses?<a id="noteref_2258" name="noteref_2258" href="#note_2258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2258</span></span></a> Can
it be that Apollo is a meaner artist than Hesiod or Homer?
On the other side, it may be said that the god is too lofty to
care to deck his utterances in the graces of literary form, or,
by a more probable theory, he inspires the vision but not the
verse. But what of the oracles of later days, which are
delivered in the baldest prose? Is this not a disturbing sign
of degeneracy? Can this be worthy of the god? The defender
of the faith has no difficulty in quieting the suspicion. Even
in the great ages we know that oracles were sometimes
delivered in prose,<a id="noteref_2259" name="noteref_2259" href="#note_2259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2259</span></span></a> and in ancient times excited feeling ran
naturally into verse.<a id="noteref_2260" name="noteref_2260" href="#note_2260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2260</span></span></a> The stately hexameter was the
appropriate form of utterance when the oracle had to deal with
great events affecting the fate of cities and of nations.
Inspiration is not independent of surrounding circumstances,
and the functions of the oracle have changed since the days of
Croesus and Themistocles. The whole style of human life and
the taste of men are less imposing and stately. The change
in the style of the oracle is only part of a general movement.<a id="noteref_2261" name="noteref_2261" href="#note_2261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2261</span></span></a>
For ages simple prose has taken the place of artistic rhythm in
other departments besides the sphere of prophecy. We do
not despise the philosophy of Socrates and Plato, because it
does not come to us clothed in verse, like the speculations of
Thales, Parmenides, and Empedocles. And who can expect the
simple peasant girl, who now occupies the tripod, to speak in
the tones of Homer?<a id="noteref_2262" name="noteref_2262" href="#note_2262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2262</span></span></a> The dim grandeur of the old poetic
oracles had indeed some advantages, in aiding the memory by
the use of measured and musical expression, and in veiling the
full meaning of the God from irreverent or hostile eyes. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their pompous ambiguity, providing apparently so many loopholes
for evasion, brought discredit on the sacred art, and
encouraged the imitative ingenuity of a host of venal
impostors who, around the great temples, cheated the ears of
slaves and silly women with a mockery of the mysterious
solemnity of the Pythian verse.<a id="noteref_2263" name="noteref_2263" href="#note_2263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2263</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The more serious question as to the cause of the extinction
of oracles brings the discussion nearer to the great problem of
the sources of inspiration. It is true that the fact may be
accounted for to some extent by natural causes. Oracles have
never ceased, but the number has been diminished. God
measures His help to men by their needs, and as they grow
more enlightened they feel less need for supernatural guidance.
This, however, is evidently dangerous ground. But surely the
poverty and depopulation of Greece are enough to account for
the disappearance of oracles. A country which can hardly
put three thousand hoplites in the field—as many as Megara
alone sent forth to fight at Plataea—cannot need the many
shrines which flourished when Greece was in its glory.<a id="noteref_2264" name="noteref_2264" href="#note_2264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2264</span></span></a> But
it may be admitted that oracles can and do disappear. And
this is in no way derogatory to the power of God. For it is
not the great God Himself who utters the warning or the
prophecy by the voice of the priestess. Such a doctrine is
lowering to His greatness and majesty. In prophecy and
divination, as in other fields, God operates, through instruments
and agents, on a given matter, and in concurrence with physical
causes. The matter in this case is the human soul, which, in
greater or less degrees, can be acted on by supernatural influences.<a id="noteref_2265" name="noteref_2265" href="#note_2265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2265</span></span></a>
The exciting cause of the <span class="tei tei-q">“enthusiasm”</span> or inspiration,
applying a sudden stimulus to the soul, may be some vapour
or exhalation from the earth, such as that which rose from the
cleft beneath the Delphic tripod.<a id="noteref_2266" name="noteref_2266" href="#note_2266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2266</span></span></a> Lastly, there is the daemon,
a supernatural being, who, by his composite nature, as we have
seen, is the channel of sympathy between the human and the
Divine.<a id="noteref_2267" name="noteref_2267" href="#note_2267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2267</span></span></a> But among the causes of afflatus or inspiration,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some may, in cases, disappear and cease to operate. The
intoxicating fume or vapour is a force of varying intensity
and may exhaust itself and be spent, as a spring may fail, or
a mine may be worked out.<a id="noteref_2268" name="noteref_2268" href="#note_2268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2268</span></span></a> The daemon may migrate from
one place to another, and with its disappearance, the oracle
will become silent, as that of Teiresias at Orchomenus has
long been, just as the lyre becomes silent when the musician
ceases to strike the strings.<a id="noteref_2269" name="noteref_2269" href="#note_2269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2269</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all this theory Plutarch is careful to guard himself against a
purely materialistic theory of the facts of inspiration.<a id="noteref_2270" name="noteref_2270" href="#note_2270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2270</span></span></a> Physical
causes may assist and predispose, but physical causes alone will
not account for the facts of inspiration. The daemon is a
necessary mediator between the human soul and God, a messenger
of the divine purpose. But the real problem of inspiration
is in the soul of man himself, in the possibility of contact
between the soul and a supernatural power. This question
is illuminated in Apuleius and Plutarch and Maximus of Tyre
by a discussion of the daemon of Socrates. It was by a natural
instinct that the Antonine Platonists went back to the great
teacher of Plato for support of the system which was to link
religion with philosophy by the daemonic theory. In Plutarch’s
dialogue on the Genius of Socrates, the various theories of that
mysterious influence current in antiquity are discussed at length.
The language in which Socrates or his disciples spoke of its monitions
lent itself to different interpretations. Was his daemon
an external sign, as in augury, an audible voice, or an inner,
perhaps supernatural light, a voice of reason, speaking to the
soul’s highest faculty, through no uttered word or symbol?<a id="noteref_2271" name="noteref_2271" href="#note_2271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2271</span></span></a>
The grosser conceptions of it may be dismissed at once. The
daemon of Socrates does not belong to the crude materialism
of divination, although the philosopher could forecast the
disaster of Syracuse.<a id="noteref_2272" name="noteref_2272" href="#note_2272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2272</span></span></a> Nor was it any ordinary faculty of keen
intellectual shrewdness, strengthened and sharpened by the
cultivation of experience. Still less was it any hallucination,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bordering on insanity, which is merely a perversion of the
senses and reason. It was rather a spiritual intuition, an
immediate vision, not darkened or weakened by passing through
any symbolic medium of the senses, a flash of sudden insight
such as is vouchsafed only to the select order of pure and
lofty spirits, in whom from the beginning the higher portion of
the soul has always risen high above the turbid and darkening
influence of the senses.<a id="noteref_2273" name="noteref_2273" href="#note_2273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2273</span></span></a> That such a faculty exists is certain to
the Platonist and the Pythagorean. But in the mass of men it is
struggling against fleshly powers, sometimes defeated, sometimes
victorious, inspiring ideals, or stinging with remorse, until
perchance, late and slowly, after chastisement and struggle, it
emerges into a certain calm. Pythagoreans, such as Apollonius,
taught that the diviner, the mantic, faculty in man was more
open to higher influences when emancipated from the body
in sleep, and that it could be set free in waking hours by
abstinence and ascetic discipline.<a id="noteref_2274" name="noteref_2274" href="#note_2274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2274</span></span></a> Plutarch laid stress on the
latter part of this theory, but ridiculed the notion that the soul
could be most clear and receptive when its powers were relaxed.
But the capacity of the higher reason in the loftier souls is
almost without limit. The reason, which is the daemon in
each, when unimpeded by bodily obstruction, is open to the
lightest, most ethereal touch. Spirit can act directly by
immediate influence upon spirit, without any sensuous aid of
word or sign.<a id="noteref_2275" name="noteref_2275" href="#note_2275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2275</span></span></a> The influence is a <span class="tei tei-q">“wind blowing where it
listeth,”</span> or a strange sudden illumination, revealing truth as by
a flash. The disembodied spirit, cleansed and freed from the
servitude of the body, and now a real daemon, possesses all
these powers and receptivities in the fullest measure. But it
gains no new power when it quits the body, although its
spiritual faculties may have been dulled and obstructed by
the flesh. The sun does not lose its native radiance when
for a moment it is obscured by clouds.<a id="noteref_2276" name="noteref_2276" href="#note_2276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2276</span></span></a> And thus a Socrates
may even here below have a spiritual vision denied to us; a
Pythia may be inspired by the daemon of the shrine to read
the future of a campaign. Nor is there anything more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wonderful in prediction than in memory.<a id="noteref_2277" name="noteref_2277" href="#note_2277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2277</span></span></a> In this unresting
flux of existence, the present of brief sensation is a mere
moment between the past which has ceased to be and the
future which is to be born. If we can still grasp the one, may
we not anticipate the other?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is thus that, by a far-reaching theory of inspiration,
Plutarch strove to rehabilitate the faith in oracular lore. The
loftier philosophic conception of the Supreme is saved from
contamination with anything earthly by the doctrine of daemons
themselves released from the body, yet, through the higher
faculty in all souls, able to act directly upon those still in the
flesh. The influence is direct and immediate, yet not independent
of purely physical causes or temperament. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
treasure is in earthen vessels.”</span> But the full vision is only
reserved for the spirit unpolluted and untroubled by sense
and passion. Plutarch is preparing the way for the <span class="tei tei-q">“ecstasy”</span>
of later Neo-Platonism. All this speculation of course lent
itself to a revival of heathen superstition. Yet it is interesting
to see how, in many a flash of insight, Plutarch reveals a truth
for all generations. We, in our time, are perhaps too much
inclined to limit the powers of the human spirit to the field of
sense and observation. The slackening hold on faith in a
spiritual world and a higher intuition may well be visited by
the proper Nemesis, in the darkening of the divine vision,
whether as religious faith or artistic inspiration. The dream
of an earthly paradise enriched with every sensuous gratification
by a science working in bondage to mere utility may have
serious results for the spiritual future of humanity. It may
need a bitter experience to dispel the gross illusion; yet men
may once more come to believe with Plutarch that, as it were,
at the back of every soul there is an opening to the divine
world from which yet may come, as of old, the touch of an
unseen hand.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Superstition in all ages is a term of unstable meaning. Men
even of the same time will apply it or deny its application to
the same belief. The devout beliefs of one period may become
mere superstitions to the next. And, conversely, what for a
time may be regarded as alien superstition, may in course of
time become an accepted portion of the native creed. This was
the history of those Eastern cults which will be described in
coming chapters. At first, they fell under Cicero’s definition
of superstition, viz. any religious belief or practice going beyond
the prescription of ancestral usage.<a id="noteref_2278" name="noteref_2278" href="#note_2278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2278</span></span></a> But a day came when
they were the most popular worships of the Roman world,
when great nobles, and even the prince himself, were enthusiastic
votaries of them.<a id="noteref_2279" name="noteref_2279" href="#note_2279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2279</span></span></a> The religion of Mithra, when it was confined
to an obscure circle of slaves or freedmen at Ostia, was a
superstition to the pontifical college. It took its place with
the cult of the Roman Trinity when Aurelian built his temple
to the Sun and endowed his priesthood.<a id="noteref_2280" name="noteref_2280" href="#note_2280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2280</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch devoted a treatise to the subject of superstition.
And his conception of it is more like our own, less formal and
external, than that of Cicero. He develops his view of the
degradation of the religious sense by contrasting it with
atheism. Atheism is a great calamity, a blindness of the
reason to the goodness and love which govern the universe.
It is the extinction of a faculty rather than the perversion of
one.<a id="noteref_2281" name="noteref_2281" href="#note_2281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2281</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>But superstition both believes and trembles. It acknowledges
the existence of supernatural powers, but they are to
it powers of evil who are ready to afflict and injure, to be
approached only in terror and with servile prostration. This
craven fear of God fills the whole universe with spectres. It
leaves no refuge whither the devil-worshipper can escape from
the horrors which haunt him night and day. Whither can he
flee from that awful presence? Sleep, which should give a
respite from the cares of life, to his fevered mind, swarms
with ghostly terrors.<a id="noteref_2282" name="noteref_2282" href="#note_2282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2282</span></span></a> And death, the last sleep, which
should put a term to the ills of life, only unrolls before the
superstitious votary an awful scene of rivers of fire and blackness
of darkness, and sounds of punishment and unutterable
woe.<a id="noteref_2283" name="noteref_2283" href="#note_2283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2283</span></span></a> To such a soul the festivals of ancestral religion lose
all their solemn gladness and cheering comfort. The shrines
which should offer a refuge to the troubled heart, even to the
hunted criminal, become to him places of torture. And the
believer in a God of malignant cruelty betakes himself in
despair to dark rites from foreign lands, and spends his
substance on impostors who trade upon his fears. Better,
says the pious Plutarch, not believe in God at all, than
cringe before a God worse than the worst of men. Unbelief,
calamity though it be, at least does not dishonour a Deity
whose existence it denies. The true impiety is to believe that
God can be wantonly faithless and revengeful, fickle and
cruel.<a id="noteref_2284" name="noteref_2284" href="#note_2284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2284</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earnestness, and even bitterness, with which Plutarch
assails the degrading fear of the supernal Powers have caused
some rather shallow critics to imagine that he had a sympathy
with scepticism.<a id="noteref_2285" name="noteref_2285" href="#note_2285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2285</span></span></a> How such an idea could arise in the mind
of any one who had read his treatise on the Genius of Socrates
or on Isis and Osiris, or on the Delays of Divine Justice, it is
difficult to imagine. Plutarch’s hatred of superstition is that
of a genuinely pious man, with a lofty conception of the Divine
love and pity, who is revolted by the travesty of pure religion,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which is repeated from age to age. It is the feeling of a man
to whom religion is one of the most elevating joys of life, when
he sees it turned into an instrument of torture. But the
force of the protest shows how rampant was the evil in that
age. Lucretius felt with the intensity of genius all the misery
which perverted conceptions of the Divine nature had inflicted
on human life.<a id="noteref_2286" name="noteref_2286" href="#note_2286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2286</span></span></a> But the force of Roman superstition had
endlessly multiplied since the days of Lucretius. It was
no longer the exaggeration of Roman awe at the lightning,
the flight of birds, the entrails of a sacrificial victim, or anxious
observance of the solemn words of ancestral formulae, every
syllable of which had to be guarded from mutilation or omission.
All the lands which had fallen to her sword were, in Plutarch’s
day, adding to the spiritual burden of Rome. If in some cases
they enriched her rather slender spiritual heritage, they
also multiplied the sources of supernatural terror. If in the
mysteries of Isis and Mithra they exalted the soul in
spiritual reverie and gave a promise of a coming life,<a id="noteref_2287" name="noteref_2287" href="#note_2287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2287</span></span></a> they
sent the Roman matron to bathe in the freezing Tiber at early
dawn and crawl on bleeding knees over the Campus Martius,
or purchase the interpretation of a dream from some diviner of
Palestine or a horoscope from some trader in astral lore.<a id="noteref_2288" name="noteref_2288" href="#note_2288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2288</span></span></a>
The Platonist, nourished on the pure theism of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span>
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Republic</span></span>, and the priest of that cheerful shrine, which

terrors which threatened to obscure the radiant visions of
Delphi and Olympus.

of the ancient bird-lore eluded the researches of the elder

decay of old Roman religion in the last century of the
Republic, which was partly due to philosophic enlightenment
partly to the confusion and demoralisation of civil strife, but
perhaps even more to the dangerous seductions of foreign
superstitions.<a id="noteref_2293" name="noteref_2293" href="#note_2293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2293</span></span></a> Among the counsels of Maecenas to Augustus

While the emperor rebuilt the fallen temples and revived the
ancient Latin rites, 2000 books of unlicensed divination were
in one day given to the flames.<a id="noteref_2295" name="noteref_2295" href="#note_2295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2295</span></span></a> The old religion, which had

certainly not free from superstition. The wrath of the
Lemures,<a id="noteref_2297" name="noteref_2297" href="#note_2297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2297</span></span></a> the darkness of the inner forest, the flash of
lightning, the flight of birds, the entrails of a sacrifice, excited
many a fear, and might cause a man to suspend a journey, or
break up an assembly of the people. But the Romans had,
in the early ages, after their orderly legal fashion, reduced the
force of these terrors by an elaborate art which provided a
convenient resource of statecraft, and a means of soothing the
alarms of the crowd.

But foreign and unregulated superstitions, from the second
century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, were pouring in from the East to put a fresh load
on the human spirit or to replace the waning faith in Italian
augury. In 139 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> Cornelius Scipio Hispalus vainly strove
by an edict to stop the inroads of the star readers.<a id="noteref_2298" name="noteref_2298" href="#note_2298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2298</span></span></a> But

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Suetonius has surpassed himself in the collection, from many
sources, of the signs and wonders which foreshadowed the
great destiny, and also the death of Augustus. And it is
noteworthy that, among these predictions, are some founded on
astrology.<a id="noteref_2301" name="noteref_2301" href="#note_2301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2301</span></span></a> On the day of the emperor’s birth, P. Nigidius,
a learned astrologer, found that the position of the stars
foretold a coming master of the world. Augustus himself
received a similar forecast from Theagenes, a star-reader of
Apollonia. He had his horoscope drawn out, and a silver coin
was struck with the stamp of Capricorn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This fatalist superstition infected nearly all the successors
of Augustus in the first and second centuries. Astrology is
essentially a fatalist creed, and the heir to the great prize of
the principate, with the absolute control of the civilised world,
was generally designated by that blind impersonal power
whose decrees might be read in the positions of the eternal
spheres, or by signs and omens upon earth. Suetonius, Tacitus,
Dion Cassius, have chronicled, with apparent faith, the
predictions of future power which gathered round the popular
candidate for the succession, or the dark warnings of coming
disaster which excited the prince’s fears and gave courage
to enemies and rivals. It is not hard to see why the
emperors at once believed in these black arts and profoundly
distrusted their professors. They wished to keep a monopoly
of that awful lore, lest it might excite dangerous hopes in
possible pretenders.<a id="noteref_2302" name="noteref_2302" href="#note_2302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2302</span></span></a> To consult a Chaldaean seer on the fate

had such implicit faith in the skill of these Eastern impostors,
along with such distrust of their honesty. They were banished
again and again in the first century, but persecution only
increased their power, and they always returned to exercise
greater influence than ever.<a id="noteref_2304" name="noteref_2304" href="#note_2304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2304</span></span></a> Never was there a clearer proof

the same fate. Nero, who despised all regular religion, except
that of the Syrian goddess, was the prey of superstitious terror.
The Furies of the murdered Agrippina, as in Aeschylean

of his nephew’s future greatness.<a id="noteref_2325" name="noteref_2325" href="#note_2325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2325</span></span></a> When the future emperor
was a young military tribune in lower Moesia, he found the
forecast confirmed by a local astrologer. He consulted the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sortes Virgilianae</span></span> about his prospects, with not less hopeful
results. He practised with intense curiosity other dark
magical arts, and the mysterious death of Antinous on the
Nile was by many believed to have been an immolation for the
Emperor’s safety.<a id="noteref_2326" name="noteref_2326" href="#note_2326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2326</span></span></a> Hadrian was glad to think that the spirit
of his minion had passed into a new star which had then for
the first time appeared. On every 1st of January, Hadrian
predicted, with perfect assurance, the events of the year, down
to his own last hour.<a id="noteref_2327" name="noteref_2327" href="#note_2327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2327</span></span></a> Even the last great imperial figure
in our period is not free from the suspicion of having
tampered with the dark arts. Julius Capitolinus reports a
rumour that M. Aurelius consulted the Chaldaeans about
the infatuated passion of Faustina for a gladiator.<a id="noteref_2328" name="noteref_2328" href="#note_2328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2328</span></span></a> In his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>account of the famous rainfall that miraculously refreshed the
Roman troops in the Marcomannic war, D. Cassius ascribes
the miracle to the magic arts of an Egyptian sorcerer whom M.
Aurelius kept in his train.<a id="noteref_2329" name="noteref_2329" href="#note_2329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2329</span></span></a> Xiphilinus, however, who attributes
the marvel to the prayers of the Thundering Legion, expressly
denies that the emperor gave his countenance to these impostors.
Another suspicious incident comes to us on the authority of
Lucian. When the war on the Danube was at its height,
the new oracle of Alexander of Abonoteichos had, by mingled
audacity and skill, rapidly gained an extraordinary influence
even among the greatest nobles in Italy. Rutilianus, one of
the foremost among them, was its special patron and devotee,
and actually married the daughter of Alexander by an
amour with Selene! Probably through his influence, an
oracle, in verse of the old Delphic pattern, was despatched
to the headquarters of the emperor, ordering that a pair
of lions should be flung into the Danube, with costly sacrifices
and all the fragrant odours of the East.<a id="noteref_2330" name="noteref_2330" href="#note_2330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2330</span></span></a> The oracle was
obeyed, but the rite was followed by an appalling disaster to
the Roman arms. The impostor was equal to the occasion,
and defended himself by the example of the ambiguity of
the Delphic oracle to Croesus, before the victory of Cyrus.
What part M. Aurelius had in this scene we cannot pretend
to tell, but the ceremony could hardly have been performed
without, at least, his connivance. Nor does his philosophic
attitude exclude the possibility of a certain faith in oracular
foresight and divination. He believed that everything in
our earthly lot was ordained from eternity, and, with the
Stoic fatalism, he may have held the almost universal Stoic
faith in the power to discover the decrees of fate.<a id="noteref_2331" name="noteref_2331" href="#note_2331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2331</span></span></a>

Nearly all the writers from whom we derive our impressions
of that age were more or less tinged with its superstitions.
Even the elder Pliny, who rejected almost with scorn the
popular religion, was led by a dream to undertake his history
of the wars in Germany.<a id="noteref_2332" name="noteref_2332" href="#note_2332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2332</span></span></a> His nephew, although he rejoiced
at being raised to the augurate, and restored a temple of Ceres

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as a matter of sentiment than from any real faith. But he
had a genuine belief in dreams and apparitions, and he sends his
friend Sura an elaborate account of the romance of a haunted
house at Athens.<a id="noteref_2333" name="noteref_2333" href="#note_2333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2333</span></span></a> His friend Suetonius had been disturbed

of dreams by contraries.<a id="noteref_2334" name="noteref_2334" href="#note_2334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2334</span></span></a> The biographer of the Caesars may
contend with Dion Cassius for the honour of being probably

Immensely superior in genius as Tacitus is to Suetonius,
even he is not emancipated from the superstition of the age.
But he wavers in his superstition, just as he wavers in his
conception of the Divine government of the world.<a id="noteref_2339" name="noteref_2339" href="#note_2339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2339</span></span></a> Although
he occasionally mentions, and briefly discusses, the tenets of the
Epicurean and the Stoic schools, it does not seem probable that
Tacitus had much taste for philosophy. Full of the old senatorial
ideals, he considered such a study, if carried to any depth,
or pursued with absorbing earnestness, to be unbecoming the
gravity and dignity of a man of rank and affairs.<a id="noteref_2340" name="noteref_2340" href="#note_2340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2340</span></span></a> Moreover,
his views of human destiny and the Divine government were
coloured and saddened by the Terror. Having lived himself
through the reign of Domitian, and seen all the horrors of its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>close, having witnessed, in humiliating silence, the excesses
of frenzied power and the servility of cringing compliance,
Tacitus had little faith either in Divine benevolence or in
tempted human virtue.<a id="noteref_2341" name="noteref_2341" href="#note_2341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2341</span></span></a> Even the quiet and security of
Trajan’s reign seemed to him but a precarious interval, not to
be too eagerly or confidently enjoyed, between the terror of
the past and the probable dangers of a coming age.<a id="noteref_2342" name="noteref_2342" href="#note_2342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2342</span></span></a> The

And, in the chaos of human affairs, the Divine justice is
confused; the good suffer equally with the guilty.<a id="noteref_2344" name="noteref_2344" href="#note_2344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2344</span></span></a> Amid
obscure and guarded utterances, we can divine that, to Tacitus,
the ruling force in human fortunes is a destiny which is blind
to the deserts of those who are its sport.<a id="noteref_2345" name="noteref_2345" href="#note_2345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2345</span></span></a> He probably held
the widespread belief that the fate of each man was fixed
for him at his birth, and, although he has a profound scorn for
the venality and falsehood of the Chaldaean tribe, he probably
had a wavering faith in the efficacy of their lore.<a id="noteref_2346" name="noteref_2346" href="#note_2346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2346</span></span></a> Nor did

subjects is often perhaps studiously ambiguous. Sometimes he
appears to report the tale of a portent, as a mere piece of vulgar
superstition. But at other times, he records the marvel with
no expression of scepticism.<a id="noteref_2348" name="noteref_2348" href="#note_2348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2348</span></span></a> And in his narrative of Otho’s
death and the miracles of Vespasian, the threats of heaven
which ushered in Galba’s brief reign in darkness broken by
lurid lightnings, the neglected signs of the coming doom of
Jerusalem, the glare of arms from contending armies in the
sky, the ghostly voices, as of gods departing from the Holy of
Holies, as in the tale of many another omen, dream, or oracle,
the historian gives an awe and grandeur to a superstition which
he does not explicitly reject.<a id="noteref_2349" name="noteref_2349" href="#note_2349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2349</span></span></a>

Nor need we be superciliously surprised that the greatest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>master of historic tragedy, born into such an age, should have

coincided with the last years of Nero.<a id="noteref_2350" name="noteref_2350" href="#note_2350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2350</span></span></a> His youthful
imagination must have been disordered and inflamed by the
tales, circulating in grave old Senatorial houses, of wild excess
or mysterious crime on the Palatine, the daring caprice of
imperial harlots, the regal power and fabulous wealth and
luxury of the imperial freedmen, the lunacy of the great line
which had founded the Empire, and which seemed destined to
end it in shame and universal ruin. That the destinies of the
world should be at the mercy of a Pallas, a Caligula, or an
Agrippina was a cruel trial to any faith. The carnival of lust
and carnage in which the dynasty disappeared,<a id="noteref_2351" name="noteref_2351" href="#note_2351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2351</span></span></a> the shock of
the fierce struggle on the Po, in which the legions of the East
and the West fought with demoniac force for the great prize,
deepened the horrors of the tragedy and the gloomy doubts of
its future historian. The dawn of a timorous hope, which broke
under the calm, strong rule of Vespasian, was overcast, during
the early manhood of Tacitus, by the old insanity of power which
seemed to revive in the last of the Flavians. Such an experience
and such an atmosphere were enough to disorder any imagination.
The wild Titanic ambition in the Claudian Caesars, a
strange mixture of vicious, hereditary insanity,<a id="noteref_2352" name="noteref_2352" href="#note_2352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2352</span></span></a> with a fevered
imagination which, intoxicated with almost superhuman power,
dreamt of unheard of conquests over nature, made the Julio-Claudian
emperors, in the eyes of men, a race half-fiend, half-god.
Men hated and loathed them, yet were ready to deify
them. It did not seem unnatural that Caligula should throw
a gigantic arch over the Forum, to link the imperial palace
with the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol.<a id="noteref_2353" name="noteref_2353" href="#note_2353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2353</span></span></a> Men long refused
to believe in the death of Nero, and his reappearance was
expected for generations.<a id="noteref_2354" name="noteref_2354" href="#note_2354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2354</span></span></a> In spite of the Augustan revival,
the calm, if rather formal, sanity of old Roman religion had
lost its power over cultivated minds. The East, with its
fatalist superstitions, its apotheosis of lofty earthly sovereignty,
its enthronement of an evil power beside the good, was
completing the overthrow of the national faith. The air was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>full of the lawless and the supernatural. Science, in the
modern sense, was yet unborn; it was a mere rudimentary
mass of random guesses, with as little right to command the
reason as the legends which sprang from the same lawless
imagination. Philosophic speculation in any high sense had
almost disappeared. The most powerful system which still
lingered, resolved the gods into mere names for the various
potencies of that dim and awful Power which thrills through
the universe, which fixes from the beginning the destinies of
men and nations, and which deigns to shadow forth its
decrees in omen or oracle. Awestruck and helpless in the
face of a cruel and omnipresent despotism, with little light from
accredited systems of philosophy or religion, what wonder that
even the highest and most cultivated minds were darkened
and bewildered, and were even ready to lend an ear to the
sorcery of the mysterious East? The hesitating acceptance
of the popular belief in clairvoyance hardly surprises us in a
man like Tacitus, bewildered by the chaos of the Empire, and
possessing few reasoned convictions in religion or philosophy.
It is more surprising to find so detached a mind as Epictetus
recognising in some sort the power of divination. He admits
that men are driven to practise it by cowardice or selfish
greed.<a id="noteref_2355" name="noteref_2355" href="#note_2355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2355</span></span></a> He agrees that the diviner can only predict the
external changes of fortune, and that on their moral bearing,
on the question whether they are really good or evil, he can
throw no light. Yet even this preacher of a universal
Providence, of the doctrine that our true good and happiness
are in our own hands, will not altogether deny that the augur
can forecast the future. We should, indeed, Epictetus says,
come to consult him, without any selfish passion, as a wayfarer
asks of a man whom he meets which of two roads leads to
his journey’s end.<a id="noteref_2356" name="noteref_2356" href="#note_2356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2356</span></span></a> But the field for such guidance is limited,
Where the light of reason or conscience is a sufficient guide,
the diviner’s art is either useless or corrupting. Nor should
any ominous signs deter a man from sharing a friend’s peril,
even though the diviner may give warning of exile or death.

his religious attitude. The immediate interference of the
Heavenly Powers, to reward the pious believer, or to punish the

presages, and warning dreams startle the reader on every page.
Aelian wages war <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à outrance</span></span> with the effeminate and profane
crew of the Epicureans, whom he would certainly have handed

the morning paean, begged the god for relief and healing. It
came before the evening, and the grateful bird, with crest
erect, with stately tread, and flapping wings, gave voice to his
deliverance in his own peculiar notes of praise! The Divine
vengeance is also displayed asserting itself in dreams. A
traveller, stopping for the night at Megara, had been murdered
for his purse of gold by the keeper of his inn, and his corpse,
hidden in a dung-cart, was carried through the gates before
dawn. At that very hour his wraith appeared to a citizen
of the place, and told him the tale of the tragedy. The
treacherous assassin was caught at the very point indicated
by the ghost.<a id="noteref_2368" name="noteref_2368" href="#note_2368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2368</span></span></a> The last dream of Philemon is of a more

in possession of all his powers, once had a vision in his home
at Peiraeus. He thought he saw nine maidens leaving the
house, and heard them bidding him adieu. When he awoke,
he told the tale to his boy, and finished the play on which he
was at work; then, wrapping himself in his cloak, he lay down
to sleep, and when they came to wake him, he was dead.
Aelian challenges Epicurus to deny that the maidens of the
vision were the nine Muses, quitting an abode which was soon
to be polluted by death.

Publius Aelius Aristides is one of the best representatives
of the union of high culture with the forces of the religious
revival. He saw the beginning and the end of the Antonine
age. He was born in 117 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> at Adriani, in Mysia, where his
family held a high position, his father being priest of Zeus.
He received the most complete rhetorical training, and had been
a pupil of Herodes Atticus. Travelling through Greece, Italy,
and Egypt, and giving exhibitions of his skill in the fashion
of the day,<a id="noteref_2370" name="noteref_2370" href="#note_2370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2370</span></span></a> Aristides won a splendid reputation, which swelled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his vanity to proportions rare even in a class whose vanity
was proverbial. He won the restoration of the ruined Smyrna
from M. Aurelius, by an oration which moved the Emperor to
tears.<a id="noteref_2371" name="noteref_2371" href="#note_2371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2371</span></span></a> With a naturally feeble constitution and epileptic
tendencies, the excitement of the sophist’s life brought on an
illness which lasted thirteen years. During that long ordeal,
he developed a mystic superstition which, along with an ever-growing
self-consciousness, inspired the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sacred Orations</span></span>, which
appeared in 177, long after his health had been restored. He
visited many seats of sacred healing—Smyrna, Pergamum,
Cyzicus, Epidaurus—and, often in a cataleptic state, between
sleep and waking, he had visitations of the Higher Powers in
dreams. They gave him prescriptions of the strangest remedies,
along with eulogies on his unrivalled talent, which he was
solemnly enjoined to devote to the celebration of his deliverance
by the Divine favour.<a id="noteref_2372" name="noteref_2372" href="#note_2372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2372</span></span></a>

Aristides zealously obeyed the Divine command. But

its exuberant pride in the power of words, its indifference to
truth, in comparison with rhetorical effect. The whole force of
revived Hellenism was concentrated in this declamatory skill.<a id="noteref_2374" name="noteref_2374" href="#note_2374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2374</span></span></a>
At the same time, the religious revival was very far from being
a return to the old religion, in its clear firm outlines and
simple wholeness.<a id="noteref_2375" name="noteref_2375" href="#note_2375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2375</span></span></a> The Zeus and Athene and Poseidon of the
age of Aristides were not the divinities of the great age.
Many influences had been at work to blur the clean-cut outlines
of Hellenic imagination, and to sophisticate the ancestral
faith both of Greece and Rome. Men wished to believe in
the ancient gods, but they were no longer the gods of Homer
or of Aeschylus, the gods worshipped by the men who fought
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the Samnite or the Punic wars. Greek philosophy for eight
centuries had been teaching a doctrine of one Divine force or
essence, transcending the powers and limitations of sense, or
immanent in the fleeting world of chance and change. Pagan
theology had elaborated a celestial hierarchy, in which the
Deity, removed to an infinite distance, was remotely linked to
humanity by a graduated scale of inferior spiritual beings,
daemons, and heroes.<a id="noteref_2376" name="noteref_2376" href="#note_2376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2376</span></span></a> Then came the religions of the East,
with their doctrines of expiation for sin and ascetic preparation
for communion, and visions of immortality. And, alongside
of all these developments, there was a portentous growth of
vulgar superstition, belief in dreams, omens, and oracles, in
any avenue to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Mystery.”</span> Sophistic rhetoric, from
its very nature and function, was bound to reflect the religious
spirit of the age, in all its confusion. The ancient myths,
indeed, were revived and decked out with rich poetic colouring.
Yet it is not the simple, naïve, old pagan faith which inspires
the rhetorical artist. The pantheistic or theosophist doctrines,
which were in the air, disturbed the antique character of the
<a name="corr459" id="corr459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">piece.</span><a id="noteref_2377" name="noteref_2377" href="#note_2377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2377</span></span></a> But the sophist, if he occasionally catches the tone
of new mysticism, or even of rationalist interpretation, is
nothing if not orthodox on the whole, and he anathematises
the impiety of free-thinking philosophy, with the same energy
as Aelian. Above all, Aristides is in harmony with the infinite
faith in miracle and heavenly vision which was rife.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From whatever cause, the worship of Asclepius had
attained an extraordinary popularity in the age of the Antonines.<a id="noteref_2378" name="noteref_2378" href="#note_2378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2378</span></span></a>
The conditions of health and disease are so obscure,
the influences of will and imagination on our bodily states
are so marked, that, in all ages, the boundaries between the
natural and the unknowable are blurred and may be easily
crossed. The science of medicine, even down to the age of
Hippocrates, or the age of Galen, had not abandoned all faith
in the magical and mysterious.<a id="noteref_2379" name="noteref_2379" href="#note_2379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2379</span></span></a> Incantations long held their
ground beside more scientific remedies. Health being the
most precious and the most precarious of earthly blessings, it
is not strange that, in an age of revived belief in the
super<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>natural, the god of health should attain a rank even on
level with the great Olympian gods. His temples rose in every
land where Greek or Roman culture prevailed. They were
generally built with an eye to beauty of scenery, or the virtues
of some clear, cold, ancient spring, or other health-giving
powers in the site, which might reinforce the more mysterious
influences of religion. And in every temple there was a
hierarchy of sacred servants, who guarded a tradition of
hieratic ceremonial and of medical science.<a id="noteref_2380" name="noteref_2380" href="#note_2380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2380</span></span></a> There was the
chief priest, who may or may not have been a trained physician.
There were the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daduchi</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pyrophori</span></span>, who attended to the
punctual service of the altars. There were the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">neocori</span></span>,
who were probably physicians, and who waited on the
patients, interpreting their visions, and often supplementing
them by other visions of their own.<a id="noteref_2381" name="noteref_2381" href="#note_2381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2381</span></span></a> There were also, in a
lower rank, nurses, male and female, who, if we may judge
from Aristides, performed the sympathetic part of our own
hospital-nurses.<a id="noteref_2382" name="noteref_2382" href="#note_2382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2382</span></span></a> The patients came from all parts of the
Graeco-Roman world. After certain offerings and rites, the
sufferer took his place in the long dormitory, which often contained
beds for 200 or 300, with windows open all night
long to the winds of the south. The sick man brought his
bed-coverings, and made his gift on the altar. The lamps were
lighted in the long gallery, a priest recited the vesper prayers.
At a later hour, the lights were extinguished, strict silence was
enjoined, and a hope for some soothing vision from above was
left as a parting gift or salutation by the minister as he
retired.<a id="noteref_2383" name="noteref_2383" href="#note_2383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2383</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Divination by dreams was one of the most ancient and
universal of superstitions in the pagan world.<a id="noteref_2384" name="noteref_2384" href="#note_2384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2384</span></span></a> It was also one
of the most persistent to the last days of paganism in the West.
The god of Epidaurus was still visiting his votaries by night,
when S. Jerome was composing his commentary on Isaiah.<a id="noteref_2385" name="noteref_2385" href="#note_2385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2385</span></span></a>
Nor is the superstition unnatural. Sleep, the most mysterious
of physical phenomena, gives birth to mental states which are
a constant surprise. Thoughts and powers which are latent
in the waking hours, then start into life with a strange
vivid<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ness and energy. Memory and imagination operate with a
force which may well, in an age of faith, be taken for inspiration.
The illusion of a double personality, which results from
the helplessness of the mind to react on the impressions of
sense, also easily passes into the illusion of messages and
promptings from powers beyond ourselves. Religious hopes
and cravings may thus easily and honestly seem to be fulfilled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But external causes also reinforced in the ancient world
the deceptions of the inner spirit. The dream-oracle was
generally on a site where nature might touch the awe and
imagination of the votary. Few could have descended into the
gloom of the cave of Trophonius without having their fancy
prepared for visions.<a id="noteref_2386" name="noteref_2386" href="#note_2386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2386</span></span></a> Exhalations from secret chasms, as at
Delphi and Lebadea, aided by the weird spells of the Nymphs
who haunted such scenes, often produced a physical excitement
akin to madness. Opiates and potions administered by
the priests, with the effect of solemn religious rites, prepared
the votary for voices from another world.<a id="noteref_2387" name="noteref_2387" href="#note_2387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2387</span></span></a> Soul and body
were still further prepared for the touch of a Divine hand by
rigorous fasting, which was enjoined as a preparatory discipline
in so many mysteries of the renascent paganism.<a id="noteref_2388" name="noteref_2388" href="#note_2388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2388</span></span></a> The

for the sake of healing became a great, and probably in the
main, a beneficent institution in the temples of many deities,<a id="noteref_2390" name="noteref_2390" href="#note_2390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2390</span></span></a> pre-eminently
in those of Isis, Serapis, and Asclepius. The temple
of Serapis at Canopus in Strabo’s time was thronged by patients
of the noblest rank, and was famous for its miraculous cures.<a id="noteref_2391" name="noteref_2391" href="#note_2391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2391</span></span></a>
Among the many attributes of Queen Isis, none made a deeper
impression than her benignant power of healing even the most
desperate cases.<a id="noteref_2392" name="noteref_2392" href="#note_2392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2392</span></span></a> Her temples rose everywhere. Her dream

shrine at Smyrna Aristides had many of his most startling
experiences. According to Diodorus, her priests could point
to numberless proofs of the power of the great goddess to cure
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the most inveterate disease. But the great healer was, of
course, Asclepius. The remains of his splendid shrine at
Epidaurus are a revelation at once of his fame and power,
and of the scenes and occupations in which the devout health-seekers
passed their days and nights. In his temple on the
island in the Tiber, dreams of healing were still sought in the
time of Iamblichus. His shrine at Pergamum, which was
the scene of so many of the strange visions of Aristides, in
his many years of struggle with disease, was one of the most
famous, and its inspired dreams were sought long afterwards
by the emperor Caracalla.<a id="noteref_2394" name="noteref_2394" href="#note_2394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2394</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be idle to speculate on the relative effects of
sound medical treatment and of superstition, stimulated by
more or less pious arts, upon the constitution of the sufferer.
The virtues of herb or mineral drug, of regulated food and
abstinence, of bathing in naturally medicated waters, above
all of a continual freshness in the air, must have become a
tradition in these sacred homes of the god of health. Physical
disease is often rooted in moral disorder, and for such troubled,
tainted souls, with hereditary poison in vein and nerve, the
bright cheerfulness, the orderly calm and confidence of the
ritual, which had such a charm for the soul of Plutarch, may
have exorcised, for the time, many an evil spirit, and wiped
out the memory of old sins. Soothed and relieved in mind
and body, the sufferer lay in the dimly lighted corridor,
sinking to sleep, with a confidence that the god would somehow
make his power felt in visions of the night.<a id="noteref_2395" name="noteref_2395" href="#note_2395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2395</span></span></a> Through
a sliding panel, hidden in the wall, a dim figure of gracious

strange sweet words of comfort. But in many cases, there is
no need to assume the existence of sanctified imposture.<a id="noteref_2396" name="noteref_2396" href="#note_2396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2396</span></span></a> A
debilitated frame, nerves shattered by prolonged suffering, an
imagination excited by sacred litany, ghostly counsels and tales

come from another world.<a id="noteref_2397" name="noteref_2397" href="#note_2397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2397</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But from whatever source the visions came, they had a
powerful effect on the imagination, and, through that, on the
bodily health. Some of the prescriptions indeed given by
these voices of the night may seem to us ludicrous or
positively dangerous.<a id="noteref_2398" name="noteref_2398" href="#note_2398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2398</span></span></a> But the tone and surroundings of
these shrines, and the sense of being encompassed by Divine
as well as human sympathy, probably counteracted any ill
effects of quackery. The calm, serene order, which the
hieratic spirit cultivates at its best, the cheerful routine of
the sacred service, blending indistinguishably with the ministry
to suffering, and consecrating and ennobling it, the confidence
inspired by the sedate cheerfulness of the priests and attendants,
reinforced by the countless cases of miraculous cures
recorded on the walls,<a id="noteref_2399" name="noteref_2399" href="#note_2399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2399</span></span></a>—all this must have had a powerful
and beneficent influence. And the visitors were not all
invalids. The games and festivals drew together many merely
for society and amusement. The theatre at Epidaurus
must have provided constant entertainment for a far larger
concourse than the patients of the temple.<a id="noteref_2400" name="noteref_2400" href="#note_2400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2400</span></span></a> A healthy
regimen, which is abundantly attested,<a id="noteref_2401" name="noteref_2401" href="#note_2401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2401</span></span></a> with the charms
of art and surrounding beauties of hill and woodland, tended
of themselves to restore peace and balance to disordered
nerves. And the social life, especially to Greeks, was
probably the most potent influence of all. We can see from
Aristides that troublesome cases were watched by a circle of
curious sympathisers.<a id="noteref_2402" name="noteref_2402" href="#note_2402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2402</span></span></a> In those marble seats, which can still
be seen on the site, many a group, through many generations,
must have sat listening to music or recitation, or discussing
high themes of life and death, or amused with the more trivial
gossip of all gatherings of men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Amid such scenes Aristides spent thirteen years of the
prime of his manhood. With all the egotism of the self-pitying
invalid, he has recorded the minutest details of his
ailments. He seems to have been disordered in every organ,
dropsical, asthmatic, dyspeptic, with a tumour of portentous
size, and agonising pains which reduced him to the extremity
of weakness.<a id="noteref_2403" name="noteref_2403" href="#note_2403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2403</span></span></a> But the extraordinary toughness and vitality
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the man is even more striking than his sufferings. Aristides
regarded health as the greatest of all blessings, the condition
on which the value of all other blessings depends. And he
acted on the belief. His hundred days journey to Rome is
a miracle of endurance.<a id="noteref_2404" name="noteref_2404" href="#note_2404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2404</span></span></a> Racked with fever and asthma,
unable to take any food except milk, he struggled along, alternately
through plains turned into lakes, or across the frozen
Hebrus, amid storm or rain or freezing cold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The effects of this journey in aggravated suffering from
asthma, dropsy, nervous agony, are described with painful
vividness. They were dealt with by the Roman surgeons in a
fashion which makes one wonder how the patient survived such
laceration.<a id="noteref_2405" name="noteref_2405" href="#note_2405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2405</span></span></a> The invalid hastened home to Asia by sea. The
voyage was long and weary, a very Odyssey of storm and
wandering. Aristides reached Smyrna in mid-winter, and all
the physicians were puzzled to find any alleviation for his
troubles.<a id="noteref_2406" name="noteref_2406" href="#note_2406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2406</span></span></a> Henceforth he passed, for thirteen years, from
one temple to another, at the bidding of the gods—from
Smyrna to Pergamum, or Chios, or Cyzicus, or Epidaurus—enduring
often frightful hardships by land or sea. The
description of his sufferings sometimes excites the suspicion
that a warm imagination and the vanity of the literary artist
have heightened the effect. A tumour of monstrous size,<a id="noteref_2407" name="noteref_2407" href="#note_2407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2407</span></span></a>
agonies of palpitation and breathlessness, the torture of
dyspepsia, vertigo, and neuralgia which doubled up his limbs,
and seemed to bend the spine outward like a bow<a id="noteref_2408" name="noteref_2408" href="#note_2408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2408</span></span></a>—these
are only a few of the morbid horrors which afflicted him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The divine prescriptions were often as astounding as the
malady was severe. Fresh air, exercise, bathing in the sacred
wells, fasting and abstinence, indeed, may often have been
sound treatment. But to these were added astonishing
prescriptions of food or drugs, purgings and blood-letting
which drained the body of its slight remaining strength, and
which horrified the attendant physicians.<a id="noteref_2409" name="noteref_2409" href="#note_2409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2409</span></span></a> But these were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not the worst. Again and again, Aristides was enjoined, when
in a high fever, to bathe two or three times in an ice-cold
river running in full flood, and then race a mile at full speed
in the face of a northerly gale. He obeyed in spite of all
remonstrance, and the doctors and his anxious friends could
only follow him to await the result of such extraordinary
remedies. Strange to relate, their fears and forebodings
proved groundless. Religious excitement, combined with
immense vanity and a strange vitality, carried Aristides
victoriously through these ordeals,<a id="noteref_2410" name="noteref_2410" href="#note_2410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2410</span></span></a> and his friends received
him at their close, with an indescribable genial warmth spreading
through his whole body, and a lightness and cheerfulness
of spirit which more than rewarded him for these strange
hardships of superstition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The faith of Aristides must have been very robust. His
tortures lasted for nearly thirteen years, during which the
divine prescriptions only seemed to add to their poignancy.
But he was upheld by the belief that he was a special object
of the Divine favour, and he persistently followed Divine
recipes, which ordinary human skill and prudence would have
rejected. No doubts, such as troubled his attendants, ever crossed
his mind. How far his illness was prolonged by this obstinate
adherence to the illusions of sleep and superstition,<a id="noteref_2411" name="noteref_2411" href="#note_2411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2411</span></span></a> in the
face of expert advice, is a matter on which it would be useless
to speculate. It is probable that the imagination and exuberant
vanity of Aristides made him a more difficult patient
than the ordinary people who frequented these shrines of
healing. It is also evident that there was a body of more or
less skilled medical opinion connected with the cult of Asclepius.
Practical physicians came to the temples,<a id="noteref_2412" name="noteref_2412" href="#note_2412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2412</span></span></a> with the benevolence
and the curiosity of their craft in all ages, to observe and study,
or to advise a cautious interpretation of the revelations of the
night. Aristides has preserved the names of some—Theodotus,
Asclepiacus, and Satyrus. Long observation of the freaks of
individual temperament and constitution must have suggested
to thoughtful minds, with some instincts of scientific method,
that the supernatural vision should be interpreted in the light
of experience. An awful dream of Aristides that all his bones
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg 466]</span><a name="Pg466" id="Pg466" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and sinews must be excised, turned, in the hands of a faithful
attendant, into a prediction of renewed vitality.<a id="noteref_2413" name="noteref_2413" href="#note_2413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2413</span></span></a> And although
some of the nurses, to whom he is so grateful, confirmed his
visions by precisely similar revelations of their own,<a id="noteref_2414" name="noteref_2414" href="#note_2414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2414</span></span></a> others, of
the more skilled physicians, openly blamed his too confident
reliance on his dreams, and his unwillingness to try the effect
of more scientific treatment.<a id="noteref_2415" name="noteref_2415" href="#note_2415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2415</span></span></a> Their proposals, however, were
sometimes so severe and heroic that we may excuse him for
preferring on the whole the more patient and gentle methods
of the god. The sufferer was sometimes favoured with
epiphanies of Athene, Apollo, Serapis, and other great
divinities, exalting him far above the rank of common votaries.<a id="noteref_2416" name="noteref_2416" href="#note_2416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2416</span></span></a>
And Asclepius himself, to whom his special devotion was
given, not only lightened his physical tortures, although after
long years, but endowed him with hitherto unknown powers
of rhetorical skill and readiness. The god became the patron
of his whole professional life.<a id="noteref_2417" name="noteref_2417" href="#note_2417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2417</span></span></a> And Aristides regarded him
as the source of fresh inspiration, in the exercise of that wordcraft
of which he was the greatest master in his time. It is
not hard to discern the meaning of this self-deception. Before
Aristides began to visit the temples of the god, he was already
a finished rhetor, possessed of all the skill which the Greek
schools could impart.<a id="noteref_2418" name="noteref_2418" href="#note_2418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2418</span></span></a> Prostrated by bodily suffering for years,
cut off from that life of brilliant display, which was so lavishly
rewarded by applauding crowds, the vain and ambitious
declaimer had lost not only his bodily health, but all the joy
and excitement of rhetorical triumph. Suddenly he found his
balance restored; the tide of energy returned to its old channels.
He could once more draw music from the almost forgotten
instrument. He had once more the full lecture-hall under his
spell. What wonder that he should feel his powers redoubled
when they were recovered, and that he should regard the god
who had healed his bodily ailments as the author of a fresh
literary inspiration?

scepticism to doubt that Aristides believed in his visions, and
in the beneficent power of the god, for which he was full of
pious gratitude. Yet the rhetorical spirit of that age was an
influence of singular intensity. It mastered not only the faculty
of utterance, but the whole mind and life of the rhetorician.
The passion to produce a startling or seductive effect on the
audience had become a second nature. Truth was a secondary
matter, not from any moral obliquity, but from the influence
of prolonged training. And so, we may retain a belief in the
genuine piety or superstition of Aristides, while we may distrust
his narrative. The piety or the mystic superstition may not
have been less sincere, although it was mingled with egregious
vanity, and expressed itself in the carefully moulded and highly
coloured phrases of the schools. Nor should we doubt the
piety of Aristides because he deemed himself the special object
of Divine favour. On such a principle all prayer for personal
benefits would become profane egotism. And although Aristides
was profoundly conscious that he was the first of Greek
orators,<a id="noteref_2421" name="noteref_2421" href="#note_2421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2421</span></span></a> he was also profoundly grateful for the Divine grace
which had renewed his powers for the glory of God and the
delight and profit of mankind. Whether he would have been
content to enjoy his mystic raptures without publishing them
to the world, is a question which will be variously answered
according to the charity and spiritual experience of the inquirer.

Many another less famous shrine than that of Epidaurus
offered this kind of revelation. The gods were liberal in their
prophetic gifts in that age, and dreams were as freely sent as
they were generally expected. There is no more striking
example of the superstition of the age than the treatise of
Artemidorus on the interpretation of dreams. Artemidorus
lived towards the end of the second century. He was a
native of Ephesus, but he called himself Daldianus, in order
to share his distinction with an obscure little town in Lydia,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which was the birthplace of his mother.<a id="noteref_2422" name="noteref_2422" href="#note_2422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2422</span></span></a> The treatise is in
five books, three of which are dedicated to Cassius Maximus,
a Roman of rank, who was an adept in this pretended
science; the others are inscribed to the son of the author.
In spite of absurd credulity, wild and perverted ingenuity
and a cold, quasi-scientific tolerance of some of the worst
moral enormities of antiquity, Artemidorus seems to have
been an earnest and industrious man, who wrote with the
mistaken object of doing a service both to his own age
and to posterity.<a id="noteref_2423" name="noteref_2423" href="#note_2423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2423</span></span></a> Like other pious men of the time, he
was afflicted by the profane attitude of the sceptics,<a id="noteref_2424" name="noteref_2424" href="#note_2424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2424</span></span></a> and
determined to refute them by the solid proofs of a sifted
experience. He also wished to furnish guidance to the crowd,
who believed in their visions, but were bewildered from the
want of clear canons of interpretation. There was evidently
afloat a voluminous oneirocritic literature. But it was, according
to Artemidorus, frequently wanting in depth and system,<a id="noteref_2425" name="noteref_2425" href="#note_2425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2425</span></span></a> and
random guesses had too often been the substitute for minute,
exhaustive observation and a clear scientific method. Artemidorus
was inspired to supply the want by a vision from Apollo,
his ancestral patron.<a id="noteref_2426" name="noteref_2426" href="#note_2426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2426</span></span></a> He procured every known treatise on
dreams.<a id="noteref_2427" name="noteref_2427" href="#note_2427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2427</span></span></a> He travelled all over Asia, Greece, and Italy, and
the larger islands, visiting the great festivals and centres of
population, and consulting with all the seers and diviners, even
those of the lowest repute. He took the greatest pains to
ascertain the facts of the reported fulfilment of dreams, and to
compare and sift the facts of his own observation. No austere
scientific student of nature in our day ever took himself more
seriously than this collector of the wildest and foulest hallucinations
of pagan imagination. Artemidorus really believed that
he was founding an enduring science for the guidance of all
coming generations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet the foundation of it all is essentially unscientific.
To Artemidorus dreams are not the result of natural causes,
of physical states, or of the suggestions of memory and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a name="Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>association. They are sent directly by some god, as a promise
or warning of the future. Nor should any apparent failure of
the prediction tempt us to impeach the truthfulness of the
Divine author. Artemidorus affirms as emphatically as Plato,
that the gods can never lie.<a id="noteref_2428" name="noteref_2428" href="#note_2428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2428</span></span></a> But although they sometimes express
themselves plainly, they also frequently veil their meaning
in shadowy, enigmatic form, in order to test men’s faith and
patience.<a id="noteref_2429" name="noteref_2429" href="#note_2429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2429</span></span></a> Hence there is need of skilled interpretation, which
demands the widest observation, acute criticism combined with
reverent faith, and deference to ancient custom and traditional
lore. It is curious to see how this apostle of what, to our minds,
is a pestilent superstition, pours his scorn on the newer or lower
forms of divination.<a id="noteref_2430" name="noteref_2430" href="#note_2430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2430</span></span></a> The Pythagorean dream-readers, the interpreters
from hand and face and form, the interpreters of sieve
and dish and dice, are all deceivers and charlatans. The old
formulated and accredited lore of birds and sacrificial entrails,
of dreams and stars and heavenly portents, should alone be
accepted by an orthodox faith. It is needless to say that
Artemidorus believed in astrology as he believed in oneiromancy.
Both beliefs go back to the infancy of the race, and
both extended their dominion far into the Middle Ages.<a id="noteref_2431" name="noteref_2431" href="#note_2431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2431</span></span></a>

It would be impossible, in our space, to give any detailed
conception of the treatment of dreams by Artemidorus. Nor
would the attempt reward the pains; the curious specialist
must read the treatise for himself. He will find in it one
of the most astonishing efforts of besotted credulity to disguise
itself under the forms of scientific inquiry. He will find an
apparently genuine piety united with an unprotesting record
of the most revolting prurience of the lawless fancy. He will
find a subtlety and formalism of system and distinction worthy
of a finished schoolman of the fourteenth century, and all
employed to give order and meaning to the wildest vagaries
of vulgar fancy. The classification of dreams by Artemidorus
is a great effort, and is followed out in an exhaustive order.
Every possible subject, and many that seem to a modern
almost inconceivable, are catalogued, each in its proper place,
with the appropriate principles of explanation. The hierarchy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg 470]</span><a name="Pg470" id="Pg470" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of gods and heroes in their various grades, the orbs of the
sky, the various parts of the bodily frame, from the hair of
the head to the toes and nails, the various occupations and
multiform incidents in the life of man from the cradle to
the grave,<a id="noteref_2432" name="noteref_2432" href="#note_2432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2432</span></span></a> the whole list of animals, plants, and drugs which
serve his uses,—all these things, and many others which might
conceivably, or inconceivably, enter into the fabric of a
dream, are painfully collected and arranged for the guidance
of the future inquirer. And this demands not only an
effort of logical classification, but also an immense knowledge
of the customs and peculiarities of different races,<a id="noteref_2433" name="noteref_2433" href="#note_2433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2433</span></span></a>
the special attributes of each of the gods, and a minute
acquaintance with the natural history of the time. For,
special circumstances and details cannot be safely neglected
in the interpretation of dreams. It may make the greatest
difference whether the same dream comes to a rich man or a
poor man,<a id="noteref_2434" name="noteref_2434" href="#note_2434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2434</span></span></a> to a man or a woman, to a married woman or a
virgin, to old or young, to king or subject. To one it may
mean the greatest of blessings, to another calamity or death.
For instance, for a priest of Isis to dream of a shaven head is
of good omen; to any other person it is ominous of evil.<a id="noteref_2435" name="noteref_2435" href="#note_2435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2435</span></span></a> To
dream that you have the head of a lion or elephant is a

that his mother was bearing him a second time; the issue

to whom the olive is sacred.<a id="noteref_2439" name="noteref_2439" href="#note_2439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2439</span></span></a> It would be wearisome, and even

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a name="Pg471" id="Pg471" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>idiotic superstition, masquerading as a science. A painstaking
student might easily classify the modes of interpretation.
They are tolerably uniform, and rest on fanciful but obvious
conceits, superficial analogies, mere play upon words and
impossible etymologies. The interpretations are as dull and
monotonous as the dreams are various and fantastic. Many
of these visions seem like the wildest hallucinations of prurient
lunacy. It is difficult to conceive what was the ordinary state
of mind and the habits of a people whose sleep was haunted
by visions so lawless. It is perhaps even harder to imagine
a father, with the infinite industry of which he is so proud,
compiling such a catalogue for the study of his son.<a id="noteref_2440" name="noteref_2440" href="#note_2440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2440</span></span></a>

Lucian, through the mouth of Momus, pours his scorn on
the new oracles which were chanting from every rock, vending
their lies at two obols apiece, and overshadowing the ancient
glories of the more ancient shrines.<a id="noteref_2441" name="noteref_2441" href="#note_2441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2441</span></span></a> In the last century of
the Republic, and in the first century of the Empire, the faith
in oracles had suffered a portentous decay. The exultation of
the Christian Fathers at the desertion of the ancient seats
of prophecy seems to find an echo in the record of heathen
authors. Cicero speaks as if Delphi were almost silent.<a id="noteref_2442" name="noteref_2442" href="#note_2442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2442</span></span></a>
Strabo tells us that Delphi, Dodona, and Ammon had shared
in the general contempt which had fallen on oracular divination.<a id="noteref_2443" name="noteref_2443" href="#note_2443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2443</span></span></a>
From Plutarch we have seen that in Boeotia, the most
famous home of the art, all the oracular shrines were silent
and deserted, except that of Trophonius at Lebadea.<a id="noteref_2444" name="noteref_2444" href="#note_2444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2444</span></span></a> And
curious inquirers gave various explanations of this waning
faith. Strabo thought that, with the spread of Roman power,
the Sibylline prophecies and the Etruscan augury eclipsed the
Greek and Eastern oracles. The explanation in Plutarch, as
we have seen, is involved in an interesting discussion of the
various sources of inspiration, and, in particular, of the office
of daemons. One theorist of the positive type attributes the
failure of the Greek oracles to the growing depopulation of
Greece. It is a question of demand and supply. Others find
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a name="Pg472" id="Pg472" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the explanation in physical changes, which have extinguished
or diverted the exhalation that used to excite the prophetic
powers of the Pythia. Another falls back on the theory of
daemonic inspiration, which, mysteriously vouchsafed, may be
as mysteriously withdrawn.<a id="noteref_2445" name="noteref_2445" href="#note_2445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2445</span></span></a>

Although Delphi had not for many ages wielded the
enormous political, and even international, power which it
enjoyed before the Persian wars, still, even in the days of its
greatest obscurity, it was the resort of many who came to
consult it in the ordinary cares of life. Apollonius of Tyana,
in the reign of Nero, visited the old oracular centres, Delphi,
Dodona, Abae, and the shrines of Amphiaraus and Trophonius.<a id="noteref_2453" name="noteref_2453" href="#note_2453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2453</span></span></a>
They seem to be still active, although the sage had, in
fulfilment of his mission, to correct their ritual. The newer
foundations, like that at Abonoteichos, found it politic to
defer to the authority of oracles, such as those of Clarus and
Didyma, with a great past.<a id="noteref_2454" name="noteref_2454" href="#note_2454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2454</span></span></a> If the conquests of Rome for

must have swelled the number of their votaries from all parts

not quite neglected. In the reign of Trajan the shrine of Delphi
recovered from its degradation by the violence of Nero.<a id="noteref_2456" name="noteref_2456" href="#note_2456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2456</span></span></a> And

But the old oracles could not satisfy the omnivorous superstition
of the time. The outburst of new oracles may be compared,
perhaps, to the fissiparous tendencies of Protestantism
in some countries, at each fresh revival of religious excitement.
Any fresh avenue to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Mystery”</span> was at once eagerly
crowded. And the most recent claimant to inspiration sometimes
threatened to overshadow the tradition of a thousand
years, and to assert an oecumenical power.

One such case has been recorded and exposed with the
graphic skill and penetrating observation of the greatest
genius of the age. Lucian’s description of the foundation of
the new oracle of Asclepius at Abonoteichos in Paphlagonia,

criticism has attained or can affect, is an unrivalled revelation

seemed to the shrewd observers the readiest prey. Tablets
were dug up, which predicted an epiphany of Asclepius at
Abonoteichos. A Sibylline oracle, in enigmatic verse, heralded
the coming of the god. Alexander, magnificently attired,
appeared upon the scene, with all the signs of mysterious
insanity, and the Paphlagonians were thrown into hysterical
excitement.<a id="noteref_2463" name="noteref_2463" href="#note_2463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2463</span></span></a> Their last new god was fished up from a lake

soon replaced by one full grown, to which a very elementary
art had attached a human head. It was displayed to the
crowds who trooped through the reception-room of the
impostor, and they went away to spread throughout all Asia the
tidings of the unheard-of miracle.<a id="noteref_2464" name="noteref_2464" href="#note_2464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2464</span></span></a> Alexander had carefully
studied the system of the older oracles, and he proceeded to
imitate it. He received inquiries on sealed tablets, and, with
all ancient pomp and ceremony of attendance, returned them,
apparently untouched, with the proper answer. But Lucian
minutely explains the art with which the seal of the missive
was dexterously broken and restored.<a id="noteref_2465" name="noteref_2465" href="#note_2465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2465</span></span></a> A hot needle and a
delicate hand could easily reveal the secret of the question,
and hide the trick. The oracle was primarily medical. Prescriptions
were given in more or less ambiguous phrases.
The charge for each consultation was, in our money, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>small fee of a shilling.<a id="noteref_2466" name="noteref_2466" href="#note_2466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2466</span></span></a> Alexander was evidently a shrewd
business man, and his moderate charges attracting a crowd of
inquirers, the income of the oracle rose, according to Lucian,
to the then enormous sum of nearly £7000 a year.<a id="noteref_2467" name="noteref_2467" href="#note_2467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2467</span></span></a> But the

spread his fame in foreign lands, and who offered the service
of the oracle in recovering runaway slaves, discovering buried
treasure, healing sickness, and raising the dead.<a id="noteref_2469" name="noteref_2469" href="#note_2469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2469</span></span></a> Even the
barbarians on the outskirts of civilisation were attracted by
his fame, and, after an interval required to find a translator
among the motley crowd who thronged from all lands, an
answer would be returned even in the Celtic or Syrian
tongue.<a id="noteref_2470" name="noteref_2470" href="#note_2470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2470</span></span></a> The fame of the oracle, of course, soon spread to
Italy, where the highest nobles, eager for any novelty in
religion, were carried away by the pretensions of Alexander.
None among them stood higher than Rutilianus, either in
character or official rank. But he was the slave of every
kind of extravagant superstition.<a id="noteref_2471" name="noteref_2471" href="#note_2471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2471</span></span></a> He would fall down and
grovel along the way before any stone which was shining
with oil or decked with garlands. He sent one emissary after
another to Abonoteichos to consult the new god. They
returned, some full of genuine enthusiasm, some hiding their
doubts by interested exaggeration of what they had seen.
Soon society and the court circle felt all the delight of a new
religious sensation. Great nobles hurried away to Paphlagonia,
and fell an easy prey to the gracious charm and the ingenious
charlatanry of Alexander.<a id="noteref_2472" name="noteref_2472" href="#note_2472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2472</span></span></a> Some, who had consulted the
oracle by questions which might have a sinister meaning, and
suggest dangerous ambitions, he knew how to terrify into his service
by the hint of possible disclosure.<a id="noteref_2473" name="noteref_2473" href="#note_2473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2473</span></span></a> All came back to swell
the fame of the Paphlagonian oracle and to make it fashionable
in Italy. But none were so besotted as Rutilianus. This great
Roman noble, who had been proved in a long career of office,<a id="noteref_2474" name="noteref_2474" href="#note_2474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2474</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg 476]</span><a name="Pg476" id="Pg476" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at the mature age of sixty, stooped to wed the supposed
daughter of the vulgar charlatan by Selene, who had honoured
him with the love which she gave of old to Endymion!<a id="noteref_2475" name="noteref_2475" href="#note_2475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2475</span></span></a>
And Rutilianus henceforth became the stoutest champion
of Alexander against all assaults of scepticism. For, in
spite of the credulity of the crowd and of the visitors from
Rome, there was evidently a strong body of sturdy dissent.
There were, in those days, followers of Epicurus even in
Paphlagonia, and, by a strange freak of fortune, the followers
of Christ found themselves making common cause against a
new outbreak of heathenism with the atheistic philosophy of
the Garden.<a id="noteref_2476" name="noteref_2476" href="#note_2476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2476</span></span></a> An honest Epicurean once convicted Alexander
of a flagrant deception, and narrowly escaped being stoned to
death by the fanatics of Paphlagonia.<a id="noteref_2477" name="noteref_2477" href="#note_2477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2477</span></span></a> One of the books of
Epicurus was publicly burnt in the agora by order of Alexander,
and the ashes cast into the sea. Lucian himself, with his sly,
amused scepticism, tested and exposed the skill of the oracle
at the most imminent risk to his life.<a id="noteref_2478" name="noteref_2478" href="#note_2478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2478</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in spite of all exposure and opposition, the oracle,
managed with such art and supported with such blind
enthusiasm, conquered for a time the Roman world. It was
a period of calamity and gloom. Plague and earthquake added
their horrors to the brooding uncertainty of the dim conflict
on the Danube.<a id="noteref_2479" name="noteref_2479" href="#note_2479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2479</span></span></a> The emissaries of Alexander went everywhere,
exploiting the general terror. Prediction of coming evil was
safe at such a time; any shred of comfort or hope was eagerly
sought for. A hexameter verse, promising the help of Apollo,
was inscribed over every doorway as an amulet against the
awful pestilence of 166 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> Another ordered two lion’s cubs
to be flung into the Danube, to check the advance of the Marcomanni.<a id="noteref_2480" name="noteref_2480" href="#note_2480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2480</span></span></a>
Both proved dismal failures, but without shaking the
authority of the impostor, who found an easy apology in the
darkness of old Delphic utterances. He established mysteries
after the model of Eleusis, from which Christians and Epicureans
were excluded under a solemn ban. Scenes of old and new
mythologies were presented with brilliant effects—the labour of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg 477]</span><a name="Pg477" id="Pg477" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Leto, the birth of Apollo, the birth of Asclepius, the epiphany
of Glycon, the new wondrous serpent-deity of Abonoteichos, the
loves of Alexander and Selene. The second Endymion lay
sleeping, as on Latmus in the ancient story, and the moon
goddess, in the person of a great Roman dame, descended from
above to woo a too real earthly lover.<a id="noteref_2481" name="noteref_2481" href="#note_2481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2481</span></span></a>

Lucian’s history of the rise of the new oracle in Paphlagonia
is not, perhaps, free from some suspicion of personal
antipathy to the founder of it. He attributes to Alexander
not only the most daring deceit and calculating quackery, but
also the foulest vices known to the ancient world. These
latter charges may or may not be true. Theological or anti-theological
hatred has in all ages too often used the poisoned
arrow. And the moral character of Alexander has less
interest for us than the spiritual condition of his many
admirers and votaries. He can hardly be acquitted of some
form of more or less pious imposture. How far it was
accompanied by real religious enthusiasm is a problem which
will be variously solved, and which is hardly worth the trouble
of investigation, even if the materials existed for a certain
answer. But the eager readiness of a whole population to
hail the appearance of a new god, and the acceptance of his
claims by men the most cultivated and highly placed in
the Roman Empire, are facts on which Lucian’s testimony,
addressed to contemporaries, cannot be rejected. Nor is there
anything in our knowledge of the period from other sources
which renders the thing doubtful. Creative mythology had
revived its activity. Not long before the epiphany of Glycon,
in a neighbouring part of Asia Minor the Apostles Paul and
Barnabas, after the miraculous cure of the impotent man, had
difficulty in escaping divine honours. The Carpocratians, a
Gnostic sect, about the same time built a temple in honour
of the youthful son of their founder.<a id="noteref_2482" name="noteref_2482" href="#note_2482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2482</span></span></a> The corn-goddess

by every age and sex and class, long after his death. His
sacred image found a place among the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">penates</span></span> of every
household, and the home where it was not honoured was of
more than suspected piety. Down to the time of Diocletian,
the saintly and philosophic emperor, who had preached an
imperturbable indifference to the chances and changes of life,
was believed to visit his anxious votaries with dreams of
promise or warning.<a id="noteref_2486" name="noteref_2486" href="#note_2486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2486</span></span></a>

The cynical voluptuary of Nero’s reign, who said that a town

used a comic hyperbole to enforce a striking fact.<a id="noteref_2488" name="noteref_2488" href="#note_2488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2488</span></span></a> The
anthropomorphic conceptions of Deity, which were prevalent,
easily overleapt the interval between the human and Divine.
The crowds of the Antonine age were as ready to recognise
the god in human form as the Athenians of the days of
Pisistratus, who believed that they saw in the gigantic Phye
an epiphany of the great goddess of their Acropolis, leading
the tyrant home.<a id="noteref_2489" name="noteref_2489" href="#note_2489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2489</span></span></a> In the minds of a philosophic minority,
nurtured on the theology of Plato, there might be the dim
conception of one awful and remote Power, far removed from
the grossness of earth, far above the dreams of mythologic
poetry and the materialist imagination of the masses. Yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a name="Pg479" id="Pg479" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even philosophy, as we have already seen, had succumbed to
the craving for immediate contact, or for some means of communication,
with the Infinite Spirit. The daemons of Plutarch
and Maximus of Tyre were really a new philosophic mythology,
created to give meaning and morality to the old gods. These
hosts of baleful or ministering spirits, with which the Platonist
surrounded the life of man, divine in the sweep of their power,
human in their passions or sympathies, belong really to the
same order as the Poseidon who pursued Odysseus with tempest,
or the Moon goddess who descended on Latmus to kiss the
sleeping Endymion. Anthropomorphic paganism was far from
dead; it was destined to live openly for more than three hundred
years, and to prolong a secret life of subtle influence under
altered forms, the term of which who shall venture to fix?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The daemons of the Platonic philosophers find their counterpart
in the popular cult of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genii</span></span>. If there was a visible
tendency to syncretism and monotheistic faith in the second
century, there was a no less manifest drift to the endless
multiplication of spiritual powers. The tendency, indeed, to
create divine representatives of physical forces and dim
abstract qualities was from early ages congenial to the Roman
mind. All the phenomena of nature—every act, pursuit, or
vicissitude in human life—found a spiritual patron in the
Roman imagination.<a id="noteref_2490" name="noteref_2490" href="#note_2490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2490</span></span></a> But the tendency received an immense
impulse in the age with which we are dealing, and the
inscriptions of the imperial period reveal an almost inexhaustible
fertility of religious fancy. Every locality, every
society and occupation of men, has its patron genius, to whom
divine honours are paid or recorded,—the canton, the municipality,
the curia; the spring or grove; the legion or cohort
or troop; the college of the paviors or smiths or actors; the
emperors, or even the great gods themselves.<a id="noteref_2491" name="noteref_2491" href="#note_2491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2491</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old gods of Latium still retained a firm hold on the
devotion of the simple masses, as crowds of inscriptions record.
But ancient religion, in its cruder forms, divided and localised
the Divine power by endless demarcations of place and
function. Although the Roman centurion or merchant might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>believe in the power of his familiar gods to follow him with
their protection, and never forgot them, still each region, to
which his wanderings carried him, had its peculiar spirits, who
wielded a special potency within their own domain, and whom
it was necessary to propitiate. On hundreds of provincial
inscriptions we can read the catholic superstition of the
Roman legionary. The mystery of desert or forest, the
dangers of march and bivouack, stimulated his devotion. If
he does not know the names of the strange deities, he will
invoke them collectively side by side with the gods whom he
has been taught to venerate. He will adore the <span class="tei tei-q">“genius
loci,”</span><a id="noteref_2492" name="noteref_2492" href="#note_2492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2492</span></span></a> or all the gods of Mauritania or of Britain. And so
the deities of Alsace and Dacia and Lusitania, of the Sahara
and Cumberland, easily took their place in his growing
pantheon.<a id="noteref_2493" name="noteref_2493" href="#note_2493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2493</span></span></a> They were constantly identified with the great
figures of Greek or Roman mythology. Many an inscription

Aesculapius.<a id="noteref_2494" name="noteref_2494" href="#note_2494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2494</span></span></a> Apollo Belenus, a favourite deity in Southern

Epidaurus. The local heroes were also adored at wayside

In a time of such vivid belief in the universal presence
of divine beings, faith in miracle was a matter of course.
Christian and pagan were here at least on common ground.
Nay, the Christian apologists did not dispute the possibility
of pagan miracles, or even of pagan oracular inspiration. It
is curious to see that Origen and Celsus, as regards the probability
of recurring miracle, are on very much the same plane
of spiritual belief, and that the Christian apologist is fighting
with one arm tied. He is disabled from delivering his assaults
at the heart of the enemy’s position. The gods of heathenism
are still to him living and potent spirits, although they are
spirits of evil.<a id="noteref_2505" name="noteref_2505" href="#note_2505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2505</span></span></a> The pagan daemonology, on its worse side,
had been accepted by the champion of the Church. Yet
it is hard to see how, on such principles, he could deal
with the daemon of the Apolline shrine at Delphi, when he
denounced the Spartan Glaucus for the mere thought of a
breach of faith to his friend,<a id="noteref_2506" name="noteref_2506" href="#note_2506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2506</span></span></a> or the daemon who lurked under
the pure stately form of Athene Polissouchos, when she threw
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a maiden goddess’s protection around the Antigones of Athens.
In the field of miracle in the second century the heathen could
easily match the Christian. With gods in every grove and
fountain, and on every mountain summit; with gods breathing
in the winds and flashing in the lightning, or the ray of sun
and star, heaving in the earthquake or the November storm in
the Aegean, watching over every society of men congregated
for any purpose, guarding the solitary hunter or traveller in
the Alps or the Sahara, what is called miracle became as
natural to the heathen as the rising of the sun. In fact, if
the gods had not displayed their power in some startling way,
their worshippers would have been shocked and forlorn. But
the gods did not fail their votaries. Unquestioning and
imperious faith in this kind is always rewarded, or can always
explain its disappointments. The Epicurean, the Cynic, or the
Aristotelian, might pour their cold scorn on tales of wonder.
An <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">illuminé</span></span> like Lucian, attached to no school, and living
merely in the light of clear cultivated sense, might shake his
sides with laughter at the tales which were vouched for by a
spiritualist philosophy. But the drift of the time was against
all such protests. The Divine power was everywhere, and
miracle was in the air.

Enough has been said of the dreams and signs and omens
which in the first and second century heralded every accession
to the throne and every death of a prince, and which even
Tacitus records with more or less vacillating faith. Enough,
too, has been said of the miracles of healing which were
wrought by the sons of Asclepius in his many shrines from
Pergamum to the island in the Tiber. The miracles wrought
by Vespasian at Alexandria are the most hackneyed example
of belief in miracle, because the tale is told by the greatest
master of vivid narrative in a book which every educated
man has read. The sensible Vespasian was not confident
of his power to give energy to the impotent, even on the
strength of a dream sent by Serapis, just as he jested on his
deathbed about his approaching apotheosis. But the efficiency
of the imperial touch was vouched for by eye-witnesses, to
whom Tacitus would not refuse his credence. The chronicler
of the age of Diocletian has surrounded the death-bed of
Hadrian with similar wonders. A blind man from Pannonia
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>came and touched the fever-wracked emperor, and immediately
regained his sight. The legend of the Thundering Legion was
long the battle-ground of opposing faiths equally credulous, and
equally bent on securing the credit of supernatural powers.
The timely rainfall was attributed with equal assurance to
the incantations of an Egyptian sorcerer, to the prayers of
the believers in Jupiter, or the prayers of the believers in
Christ. Apuleius, who was himself prosecuted for practising
the black art, has filled his Thessalian romance with the most
astounding tales of fantastic sorcery. He may have copied
other lawless romances, but he would hardly have given
such space to these weird arts if his public had not had an
uneasy belief in them. The home of Medea in the days of
M. Aurelius was a veritable witch’s cave: the air is tremulous
with superstitious fear: everything seems possible in the field
of miraculous metamorphosis or monstrous vice. If Apuleius
had meant to discredit superstition by wedding it to disgusting
sensuality, he could hardly have succeeded better. But
he was more probably bent, with perverted skill, on producing
a work which might allure imaginations haunted by
the ghosts of hereditary sensuality and a spiritual terror revived
in redoubled force. An Egyptian priest with tonsure and linen
robes raises a dead man to life who has been <span class="tei tei-q">“floating on
the Stygian streams.”</span> Or you are admitted to a witch’s
laboratory, open to all the winds and stored with all the
wreckage of human life—timbers of ships splintered on cruel
rocks, the curdled blood and mangled flesh of murdered men,
toothless skulls gnawed by beasts of prey. You see the
transformation going on before your eyes under the magic of
mysterious unguents, the feathers springing from the flesh, or
the human sinking into the ass’s form. Tales like these,
which to us are old wives’ tales, may have had a strange
charm for an age when human life was regarded as the slave
of fate, or the sport of the inscrutable powers of the unseen
universe.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A great part of the charm of those oriental religions, on the
study of which we are about to enter, lay in the assurance
which they seemed to give of an immortal life. It would,
therefore, appear a necessary preface to such a review to examine
some of the conceptions of the state of the departed
which the missionaries of Isis and Mithra found prevalent
in the minds of their future votaries. Immortality, in any
worthy sense, is inseparable from the idea of God. And the
conception of continued life must always be shaped by the
character of a people’s beliefs as to the powers of the unseen
world. A pantheon of dim phantasms or abstractions will not
promise more than a numb spectral future to the human shade.
The nectar and ambrosia of Olympian feasts may have their
human counterpart in an <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal debauch.”</span> The Platonist will
find his eternal hope in emancipation from the prison of the flesh,
and in the immediate vision of that Unity of all beauty, truth,
and goodness, which is his highest conception of God. But
not only does religion necessarily colour the conception of
the eternal state: it may also furnish the warrant for a belief
in it. And a religion which can give men a firm ground for
that faith will have an immense advantage over others which
are less clear and confident as to another world. It is generally
admitted that the long array of philosophic arguments
for immortality have by themselves little convincing power.
They are not stronger, nor perhaps so strong as the argument
from the wish for continued life, inveterate in the human
spirit, on which Plutarch laid so much stress.<a id="noteref_2507" name="noteref_2507" href="#note_2507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2507</span></span></a> Even amid the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name="Pg485" id="Pg485" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>triumphant dialectic of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span>, an undertone of doubt
in any human proof of immortality is sometimes heard, along
with the call for some <span class="tei tei-q">“divine doctrine”</span> as a bark of safety
on perilous seas.<a id="noteref_2508" name="noteref_2508" href="#note_2508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2508</span></span></a> The inextinguishable instinct of humanity

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman spirit, down to the Antonine age, had been the
subject of many influences which had inspired widely various
ideas of the future state. And the literary and funerary
remains from Nero to M. Aurelius are full of contradictions
on the subject. Nor, in the absence of authoritative revelation
on a field so dark to reason, is this surprising. Even
Christian teaching, while it offers a sure promise of a life to
come, has not lifted the veil of the great mystery, and the
material imagery of the Apocalypse, or the shadowed hints of
Jesus or S. Paul, have left the believer of the twentieth century
with no clearer vision of the life beyond the tomb than that
which was vouchsafed to Plato, Cicero, Virgil, or Plutarch.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We know not what we shall be,”</span> is the answer of every
seer of every age. Something will always <span class="tei tei-q">“seal the lips of the
Evangelist,”</span> as the key of the Eumolpidae closed the lips of
those who had seen the vision of Eleusis.<a id="noteref_2509" name="noteref_2509" href="#note_2509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2509</span></span></a> The pagans of the
early Empire were thus, in the absence of dogma and ecclesiastical
teaching, free to express, with perfect frankness, their
unbelief or their varying conceptions of immortality, according
to the many influences that had moulded them. Nor could
these influences be kept apart even in the same mind. Even
the poet seer, who was to be the guide of Dante in the shades,
has failed to blend the immemorial faith of the Latin race with
the dreams of future beatitude or anguish which came to him
from Pythagorean or Platonic teaching.<a id="noteref_2510" name="noteref_2510" href="#note_2510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2510</span></span></a> In the sixth book of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aeneid</span></span> the eschatologies of old Rome and Greece are combined,
but not blended, with the doctrines of transmigration
and purgatorial expiation descending from Pythagoras or the
Orphic mystics. Virgil, in fact, mirrors the confusion of beliefs
which prevailed in his own age, and which pre-eminently
characterised the age of the Antonines.

Along with other archaic elements of the Latin faith, the
cult of the Manes held its ground, especially in secluded homes
of old Italian piety. The most ancient Indo-European conception
of the state after death was that of a continuance or
faint, shadowy reproduction of the life on earth; it was not
that of a vast and mysterious change to a supernatural order.
The departed spirit was believed to linger in a dim existence
in the vault or grave near the familiar homestead.<a id="noteref_2511" name="noteref_2511" href="#note_2511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2511</span></span></a> The tomb

provides a chamber where the living members of the family
or clan may gather on solemn days around the ashes of the
dead.<a id="noteref_2513" name="noteref_2513" href="#note_2513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2513</span></span></a> Provision is made for the sustenance of this spectral

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With such views of the tomb, the perpetual guardianship
of it became to the Roman a matter of supreme moment. It
is a chapel or an altar, as well as a last home.<a id="noteref_2516" name="noteref_2516" href="#note_2516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2516</span></span></a> It is the
meeting-place, in faint ghostly communion, of the society which
embraced, by its solemn rites, the members of the household
church in the light or in the shades. All the cautious forms
of Roman law are invoked to keep the sepulchre, with its
garden and enclosure, from passing into alien hands. Its
site is exactly described, with the minutest measurements,
and the intruder or the alienator is threatened with curses or
with fines, to be paid into the public treasury.<a id="noteref_2517" name="noteref_2517" href="#note_2517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2517</span></span></a> Here, among

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name="Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life beneath the marble or the sod, at least in the later times,
was conceived to be, how far it involved a more or less vivid
consciousness of what was passing in the world above, how far
it was a numb repose, almost passing into <span class="tei tei-q">“the eternal sleep,”</span>
seems to be uncertain. The phrases on the tomb in all ages are
apt to pass into conventional forms, and personal temperament
and imagination must always give varying colour to the picture.
Such phrases as <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal sleep,”</span> however, did not probably at
any time imply complete unconsciousness. The old Latin
faith that the Manes had a real life and some link of
sympathy with the living was still strong and vivid in an age
which was eager to receive or answer voices from the world
beyond the senses. The wish to maintain, in spite of the
severance and shock of death, a bond of communion between
the living and the departed was one of the most imperious
instincts of the Latin race. It was not a mere imagination,
projected on far distant years, which craved for the yearly
offering of violets and roses, or the pious <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ave</span></span> of the passing
traveller.<a id="noteref_2520" name="noteref_2520" href="#note_2520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2520</span></span></a> The dwellers in the vault still remained members
of the family, to which they are linked for ever by a dim
sympathy expressed in ritual communion. Every year, on the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dies parentales</span></span> in February, there was a general holiday,
cheerfully kept in honour of all those whose spirits were at
peace.<a id="noteref_2521" name="noteref_2521" href="#note_2521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2521</span></span></a> On the eighth day, the festival of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cara cognatio</span></span>,
there was a family love-feast, in which quarrels were forgotten,
and the members in the spirit-world joined in the sacred meal.
But besides this public and national commemoration, the birthday
of each departed member was observed with offerings of wine
and oil and milk. The tomb was visited in solemn procession;
dead and living shared the sacred fare; flowers were scattered,
and with an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ave</span></span> or a prayer for help and good fortune, the
shade was left to its renewed repose.<a id="noteref_2522" name="noteref_2522" href="#note_2522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2522</span></span></a> Many a slab makes

But the Roman in his tomb longed to be near the sound of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a name="Pg488" id="Pg488" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>busy human life, and to feel the tread of pious feet, which
might turn aside for a moment to salute even a stranger’s
memory. This feeling is expressed in the long rows of vaults
which line so many of the great roads, the Via Appia, or the
way from Pompeii to Nola.<a id="noteref_2524" name="noteref_2524" href="#note_2524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2524</span></span></a> There were many like that Titus

lonely soul, cut off from the kindly fellowship of the living,
and lingering on in a forgotten grave, to which no loving hand
should ever more bring the libation or the violets in spring,
which should one day awake no memory or sympathy in
any human heart, was to the old Roman the worst terror in
death. This passion for continued memory, especially in great
benefactors of their kind, is used by Cicero as an argument
for immortality,<a id="noteref_2527" name="noteref_2527" href="#note_2527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2527</span></span></a> and the passion for enduring life blends
indistinguishably with the wish to be long remembered.
Even Epicurus, the apostle of annihilation, made provision in
his last testament for yearly offerings in honour of himself
and Metrodorus his disciple—a curious instance of agnostic
conformity.<a id="noteref_2528" name="noteref_2528" href="#note_2528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2528</span></span></a> The passion for remembrance was responded to
by the dutiful devotion of many generations. The cult of the
dead long survived in the cult of martyrs, and the pagan
feasting at their tombs disturbed and perplexed S. Augustine
and S. Paulinus of Nola.<a id="noteref_2529" name="noteref_2529" href="#note_2529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2529</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old Roman thought of his departed friends as a company
of good and kindly spirits, who watched over the family
on earth. But there was another conception of spirits in the
other world, whether derived from the gloomy superstition of
Etruria, or descending from days anterior to orderly devotion
to the dead.<a id="noteref_2530" name="noteref_2530" href="#note_2530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2530</span></span></a> The Lemures were a name of fear. They
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg 489]</span><a name="Pg489" id="Pg489" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were dark, malevolent spirits who craved for blood, as they
had departed this life by a violent end. Their festival, the
Lemuria in May, was quite distinct from the festival of the
Manes, and the household ritual for laying the ghosts by the
spitting of black beans and a ninefold form of exorcism savours
of a far-gone age. These maleficent powers were propitiated
by blood—especially by the blood of men in the combats of
the arena.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The visitations of these beings, whether as guardian,
ministering spirits or as evil powers, were expected and believed
in for many ages by all classes of Roman minds. The ancient
Latin faith as to the state of the dead was, according to Cicero,
confirmed by many tales of spiritual apparition. There are
pathetic memorials which end with an appeal in which the
lonely wife entreats the lost one sometimes to return in dream
or vision.<a id="noteref_2531" name="noteref_2531" href="#note_2531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2531</span></span></a> One vivacious inscription challenges the sceptic to

the family vault, but were gathered in a dim region near the
centre of the earth, where, according to gloomy Etrurian fancy,
they were under the cruel care of the conductor of the dead, a
brutal figure, with wings and long, matted beard, and armed
with a hammer, who for ages appeared in human form to close
the last ghastly scene in the gladiatorial combats.<a id="noteref_2534" name="noteref_2534" href="#note_2534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2534</span></span></a> From
this limbo of the departed a sort of gateway was provided in
every Latin town in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mundus</span></span>, a deep trench intended to represent
an inverted heaven, which was dug before the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pomoerium</span></span>
was traced. Its lower aperture was closed by the stone of the
Manes, which on three solemn days, in August, October, and
November, was lifted to permit the spirits from the deep to
pass for a time into the upper world. Thus a public sanction
was given to the belief in the commerce between this life and
the next.<a id="noteref_2535" name="noteref_2535" href="#note_2535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2535</span></span></a>

Cicero had said that the faith in immortality was sustained
by the fact of spirits returning to the world of sense. In the
first and second centuries there was no lack of such aids to
faith. Apparitions became the commonest facts of life, and
only the hardiest minds remained incredulous about them.
Philosophers of all schools, except the Epicurean, were swept
into the current. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philopseudes</span></span> of Lucian is a brilliant
effort to ridicule the superstition of the age, but the attack
would have been discredited if it had not had a foundation
of fact. There, around the sick-bed of Eucrates, himself
saturated with philosophy, are gathered a Stoic, a Peripatetic,
a Pythagorean, a Platonist, and a trained physician.<a id="noteref_2536" name="noteref_2536" href="#note_2536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2536</span></span></a> And

seen such spirits a thousand times, and, from long habit, has

Tartarus, the infernal rivers, and been even able to recognise some
of the ghosts below.<a id="noteref_2538" name="noteref_2538" href="#note_2538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2538</span></span></a> On another day, as he lay upon his bed

In enlarging its rather blank and poor conception of the
future state, the Latin race, as in other fields, was content to
borrow rather than invent. The Sixth Book of the Aeneid was
an effort not only to glorify the legendary heroes of Rome, but
to appease a new or revived longing for the hope of immortality,
after the desolating nihilism of the Epicurean philosophy had
run its course.<a id="noteref_2548" name="noteref_2548" href="#note_2548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2548</span></span></a> Virgil has some touches of old Roman faith

Etrurians also, who affected so profoundly the tone of Roman
religion, had come under Greek influences. The spectral ferryman
of the dead was a familiar figure in Etruscan art. Thus,
both on the south and north, Latium had points of contact
with the world of Hellenic legend. And from the early days
of the Republic, the worship of Greek gods—Apollo, Asclepius,
or the Dioscuri—became naturalised at Rome. Probably of
even earlier date was the influence of the oracular lore of
Greece through Delphi and the oracle of Cumae.<a id="noteref_2551" name="noteref_2551" href="#note_2551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2551</span></span></a>

splendour not of earth, they are, in old Roman and Greek
fashion, occupied with the toils or pleasures of their earthly
life. Youthful forms are straining their sinews in the
wrestling-ground as of old. The ancient warriors of Troy
have their shadowy chariots beside them, their lances planted
in the sward, their chargers grazing in the meadow. Others
are singing old lays or dancing, and the bard of Thrace
himself is sweeping the lyre, as in the days when he sped the
Argo through the <span class="tei tei-q">“Clashing Rocks”</span> in the quest of the fleece
of gold.<a id="noteref_2560" name="noteref_2560" href="#note_2560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2560</span></span></a>

The vision closes with a scene which criticism has long
recognised as irreconcilable with the eschatology of Greek
legend hitherto followed by the poet, but which is drawn from
a philosophy destined to govern men’s thoughts of immortality
for many ages. In a wooded vale, far withdrawn, through
which Lethe glided peacefully, countless multitudes are
gathered drinking the <span class="tei tei-q">“water of carelessness and oblivion.”</span>
These are they, as Anchises expounds to his son, who, having
passed the thousand purgatorial years, to cleanse away the
stains of flesh in a former life, and, having effaced the memory
of it, now await the call of Destiny to a new life on earth.<a id="noteref_2561" name="noteref_2561" href="#note_2561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2561</span></span></a>
This theory of life and death, coming down from Pythagoras,
and popularised by Platonism, with some Stoic elements,
had gained immense vogue among educated men of the
last period of the Republic. Varro had adopted it as a
fundamental tenet of his theology, and Cicero had embalmed
it in his dream of Scipio, which furnished a text for Neo-Platonist
homilies in the last days of the Western Empire.<a id="noteref_2562" name="noteref_2562" href="#note_2562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2562</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a name="Pg494" id="Pg494" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>A fiery spirit animates the material universe, from the farthest
star in ether down to the lowest form of animal life. The
souls of men are sparks or emanations from this general
soul which have descended into the prison of the body, and
during the period of their bondage have suffered contamination.<a id="noteref_2563" name="noteref_2563" href="#note_2563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2563</span></span></a>
And the prison walls hide from their eyes for a time
the heaven from which they come. Nor when death releases
them do they shake off the engrained corruption. For a
thousand years they must suffer cleansing by punishment till
the stains are washed away, the deeply festering taint burnt
out as by fire. Then only may the pure residue of ethereal
spirit seek to enter on another life on earth.

Virgil, in his Nekuia, mirrored the confusion of beliefs
as to the future state prevailing in his time. For his
poetic sensibility, the old Roman faith of the Manes, the
Greek legends of Tartarus and Elysium, the Pythagorean
or Orphic doctrine of successive lives and purgatorial
atonement, had each their charm, and a certain truth. On
a subject so dim and uncertain as the future life, the
keenest minds may have wavering conceptions, and in different
moods may clothe them in various guise. This is the field of
the protean poetic imagination inspired by religious intuition,
not of the rigorous dogmatist. But a great poet like Virgil
not only expresses an age to itself: he elevates and glorifies
what he expresses. He gives clear-cut form to what is vague,
he spreads the warmth and richness of colour over what is
dim and blank, and he imparts to the abstract teaching of
philosophy a glow and penetrating power which may touch
even the unthinking mass of men. The vision of the Sixth
Book, moreover, like the Aeneid as a whole, has a high note of
patriotism. Beside the water of Lethe are gathered, waiting
for their call to earthly life, all the great souls from the Alban
Silvius to the great Julius, all the Scipios, Gracchi, Decii, and
Fabricii, who were destined through storm and stress to give
the world the calm of the Roman peace.<a id="noteref_2564" name="noteref_2564" href="#note_2564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2564</span></span></a> The poet of Roman
destiny had a marvellous fame among his countrymen. Men
rose up to do him honour when he entered the theatre; the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>street boys of Pompeii scratched his verses on the walls.<a id="noteref_2565" name="noteref_2565" href="#note_2565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2565</span></span></a> Can
we doubt that the grandest part of his great poem, which lifts
for a moment the veil of the unseen world, had a profound
effect on the religious imagination of the future?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The opinion long prevailed that the period of the early
Empire was one of unbelief or scepticism as to the future life.
The opinion was founded on literary evidence accepted without
much critical care. Cicero and Seneca, Juvenal and Plutarch,<a id="noteref_2566" name="noteref_2566" href="#note_2566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2566</span></span></a>
had spoken of the Inferno of Greek legend, its Cerberus
and Chimaera, its gloom of Tartarus, as mere old wives’ fables,
in which even children had ceased to believe. But such
testimony should always be taken with a good deal of reserve.
The member of a comparatively small literary and thoughtful
circle is apt to imagine that its ideas are more widely diffused
than they really are. It may well have been that thoughtful
men, steeped in Platonic or Pythagorean faith as to the
coming life, rejected as anthropomorphic dreams the infernal
scenery of Greek legend, just as a thoughtful Christian
of our day will hardly picture his coming beatitude in the
gorgeous colouring of the Book of Revelation. Yet the mass
of men will always seek for concrete imagery to body forth
their dim spiritual cravings. They always live in that uncertain
twilight in which the boundaries of pictured symbolism
and spiritual reality are blurred and effaced. Lucian was a
pessimist as to spiritual progress, and he may have exaggerated
the materialistic superstition of his time; he had ample excuse
for doing so. Yet, artist as he was, his art would have
been futile and discredited in his own time, if it had not had
a solid background in widely accepted beliefs. And we cannot
refuse to admit his testimony that the visions of the grim
ferryman over the waters of Styx, the awful judge, the tortures
of Tartarus, the asphodel meads, and the water of Lethe, the
pale neutral shades who wandered expectant of the libation
on the grave, filled a large space in the imagination of the
crowd.<a id="noteref_2567" name="noteref_2567" href="#note_2567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2567</span></span></a> Plutarch, who sometimes agrees with Juvenal and
Seneca as to the general incredulity, at others holds that a
large class of remorseful sinners have a wholesome fear of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a name="Pg496" id="Pg496" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>legendary tortures of lost souls, and that they are eager to
purge their guilt before the awful ordeal of the Eternal
Judgment.<a id="noteref_2568" name="noteref_2568" href="#note_2568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2568</span></span></a> And, however pure and etherealised his own views
may have been as to the life to come, no one has left a more
lurid picture of the flames, the gloom, the sounds of excruciating
anguish from the prison-house of the damned, which oppressed
the imagination of the multitude in his time. One part of
that vision had a peculiarly tenacious hold.<a id="noteref_2569" name="noteref_2569" href="#note_2569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2569</span></span></a> The belief in
the gruff ferryman of the dead, who sternly exacted his fare,
and drove from the banks of Styx those who had no right to
cross the awful stream, was widely diffused and survived far
into the medieval times. For many centuries, long before and
long after the coming of Christ, the coin which was to secure
the passage of the shade into the world below was placed in
the mouth of the corpse.<a id="noteref_2570" name="noteref_2570" href="#note_2570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2570</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inscriptions might be supposed to give authoritative
evidence as to the belief of ordinary men about the future
state. The funerary monuments from every part of the
Roman world are almost countless for the period of the early
Empire. Yet such records, however abundant, are not so
clear and satisfactory as they are by some taken to be.
The words of a tombstone are sometimes a sincere utterance
of real affection and faith. They are also not unfrequently
purely conventional, representing a respectable, historic creed,
which may not be that of the man who erects the slab. Just
as a Frenchman, who has never from infancy entered a church,
may have his wife interred with all the solemn forms with
which the Catholic Church makes the peace of the passing
soul, so the Roman pagan may have often inscribed on his
family tomb words which expressed the ancient creed of his
race rather than his personal belief. Heredity in religion is
a potent influence, and may be misleading to the inquirer of
a later age. An epitaph should not be construed as a confession
of faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great mass of these inscriptions are couched in the
same phrases, with only slight variations. The dedication Dis
Manibus, representing the old Roman faith, is the heading of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the majority of them. The vault is an <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal home,”</span> whose
peace is guarded by prayers or threats and entreaties. There
is a rare dedication to the <span class="tei tei-q">“ashes”</span> of the dead. There are
many to their <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal repose.”</span><a id="noteref_2571" name="noteref_2571" href="#note_2571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2571</span></span></a> But it is surely rather
absurd to find in expressions which occur almost in the same
form in the niches of the Catacombs a tinge of Epicureanism.
The poor grammarian of Como, who left all his substance
to his town, may be permitted to enjoy <span class="tei tei-q">“the calm peace”</span> he
claims after all the troubles of his life, without a suspicion
that he meant the peace of nothingness.<a id="noteref_2572" name="noteref_2572" href="#note_2572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2572</span></span></a> A pious Christian
may rejoice at escaping the miseries of old age, and even hail
death as the last cure of all mortal ills.<a id="noteref_2573" name="noteref_2573" href="#note_2573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2573</span></span></a> Death and sleep
have always seemed near akin, and when the Roman spoke of
the sleep of death, he probably did not often mean that it had
no awaking. The morning indeed, as we have seen, to old
imaginations was not very bright. <span class="tei tei-q">“The day of eternity”</span> was
not irradiated with the golden splendour of Pindar’s Happy
Isles; it was grey and sad and calm. But that it was felt
to be a real existence is shown by the insistent demand on
scores of monuments for the regular service of the living.
Every possible precaution is taken by the testator that his
family or his club shall maintain this sympathetic observance
for ever.<a id="noteref_2574" name="noteref_2574" href="#note_2574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2574</span></span></a> With the idea of prolonged existence, of course, is
blended the imaginative hope of having a continued memory
among men. And probably the majority of the funerary
inscriptions express this feeling chiefly. But the same is true
of the monuments of every age, and warrants no conclusion as
to the opinions about immortality held by those who raised
them. There is abundance of the purest affection expressed
on these memorials, and sometimes, although not very often,
there is the hope of reunion after death. The wife of a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">philologus</span></span> at Narbonne confidently expects to meet him, or a
mother prays her son to take her to himself.<a id="noteref_2575" name="noteref_2575" href="#note_2575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2575</span></span></a> Such expressions
of a natural feeling, the same from age to age, have really little
value as indications of religious belief. But there are not wanting
in the inscriptions references to Tartarus and the Elysian
fields, to Pluto and Proserpine, to Orcus who has snatched
away some one in his bloom. <span class="tei tei-q">“One little soul has been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>received among the number of the gods.”</span><a id="noteref_2576" name="noteref_2576" href="#note_2576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2576</span></span></a> There are others,
impregnated with the prevalent philosophy, which speak of
the soul returning to its source, or of being dissolved into the
infinite ether, or of passing to a distant home in the stars.<a id="noteref_2577" name="noteref_2577" href="#note_2577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2577</span></span></a>
This, however, as M. Boissier says,<a id="noteref_2578" name="noteref_2578" href="#note_2578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2578</span></span></a> must have been the dream
of a small minority. The funerary inscriptions leave the
impression that, down to the final triumph of the Church, the
feeling of the Romans about death was still in the main the
feeling of their remote ancestors of the Samnite and Punic
wars. It was a social feeling, in the prospect of a dim life
dependent on the memory of the living, a horror of loneliness
and desertion, the longing for a passing prayer even from a
stranger. Blessings are heaped on him who will not forget
the pious duty to the shade. On him who refuses it is invoked
the bitterest curse to Roman imagination—<span class="tei tei-q">“May he die the
last of his race.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But no dogmatic ecclesiastical system deterred the Roman
from expressing frankly his unbelief in any future state.
And the rejection of all hope for the future, sometimes coupled
with a coarse satisfaction with a sensual past, is the note of
not a few epitaphs of this period. Matrinia, the wife of one
C. Matrinius Valentius, an Epicurean philosopher, dedicates a
tablet to his <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal sleep,”</span> which in this case is no conventional
phrase.<a id="noteref_2579" name="noteref_2579" href="#note_2579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2579</span></span></a> And others, in even more decided language,
parade their withering faith that this brief life is only a
moment of consciousness between the blank of the past and
the blank of the future, and record their indifference at passing
again into the nothingness from which they came.
The formula is frequent—<span class="tei tei-q">“Non fueram, non sum, nescio”</span>; or
<span class="tei tei-q">“Non fui, fui; non sum, non curo.”</span> Another adds <span class="tei tei-q">“non
mihi dolet.”</span><a id="noteref_2580" name="noteref_2580" href="#note_2580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2580</span></span></a> The subjects of some of these epitaphs
seem to have obeyed literally the counsel of their master
Lucretius, though in a sense different from his, and to have
risen up sated with the banquet of life. They express, with
cynical grossness, their only faith in the joys of the flesh, and
their perfect content at having made the most of them.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a name="Pg499" id="Pg499" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Balnea, Vina, Venus,”</span> sums up the tale.<a id="noteref_2581" name="noteref_2581" href="#note_2581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2581</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“What I have

And the departing voluptuary exhorts his friends to follow his
example: <span class="tei tei-q">“My friends, while we live, let us live”</span>; <span class="tei tei-q">“Eat,

fifth legion records, probably with much truth, that <span class="tei tei-q">“while

surviving friends to drink while they live. Under the confessional
of St. Peter’s at Rome, in the year 1626, was found
a monument of one Agricola of Tibur and his wife. There
was a figure holding a wine-cup, and an inscription so frankly
sensual that the whole was destroyed by order of the Pope.
From the copy which was kept, it appears that Agricola was
perfectly satisfied with his life, and recommended his example
to others, <span class="tei tei-q">“since it all ends in the grave or the funeral fire.”</span><a id="noteref_2585" name="noteref_2585" href="#note_2585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2585</span></span></a>
But inscriptions such as these are the exception. The funerary
records, as a whole, give a picture of a society very like our
own, with warm affections of kindred or friendship, clinging
to ancestral pieties, ready to hope, if sometimes not clear and
confident in faith.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was probably a much more settled faith in immortality
among the ordinary masses than among the highly
educated. The philosophy of Greece came to the cultivated
Roman world with many different voices on the greatest
problem of human destiny. And the greatest minds, from
Cicero to M. Aurelius, reflect the discordance of philosophy.
Nay, some of those who, in more exalted moods, have left
glowing pictures of the future beatitude, have also at times
revealed a mood of melancholy doubt as to any conscious
future life. The prevailing philosophy in the last generation
of the Republic, demoralised by an internecine strife, was
that of Epicurus.<a id="noteref_2586" name="noteref_2586" href="#note_2586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2586</span></span></a> It harmonised with the decay of old
Roman religion, and with the more disastrous moral deterioration
in the upper cultivated class. The cultivated patrician,
enervated by vice and luxury, or intoxicated with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>excitement of civil war and the dreams of disordered ambition,
flung off all spiritual idealism, and accepted frankly a
lawless universe and a life of pleasure or power, to be ended
by death. The great poem of Lucretius, the greatest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tour de
force</span></span> in Latin, if not in any literature, braving not only
the deepest beliefs of the Latin race, but the instinctive longings
of humanity, was a herculean attempt to relieve men
from the horrors of Graeco-Etruscan superstition. Even the
gay frivolity of the comic stage reveals the terror which the
path to Acheron inspired in the thoughtless crowd<a id="noteref_2587" name="noteref_2587" href="#note_2587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2587</span></span></a>—the
terror from which, with all the fervid zeal of an evangelist,
Lucretius sought to relieve his countrymen.<a id="noteref_2588" name="noteref_2588" href="#note_2588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2588</span></span></a> The pictures of
Tartarus had burnt themselves into the popular imagination.
And no message of Epicurus seems to his Roman interpreter
so full of peace and blessing as the gospel of nothingness after
death, the <span class="tei tei-q">“morningless and unawakening sleep”</span> which ends
the fretful fever of life. As we felt no trouble when the
storm of Punic invasion burst on Italy, we shall be equally

even in the clash and fusion of all the elements in some great
cosmic change.<a id="noteref_2589" name="noteref_2589" href="#note_2589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2589</span></span></a> The older Stoicism permitted the hope of a
limited immortality until the next great cataclysm, in which,
after many ages, all things will be swallowed up.<a id="noteref_2590" name="noteref_2590" href="#note_2590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2590</span></span></a> But
Chrysippus admitted this prolonged existence only for the
greater souls. And Panaetius, in the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, among
other aberrations from the old creed of his school, abandoned
even this not very satisfactory hope of immortality.<a id="noteref_2591" name="noteref_2591" href="#note_2591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2591</span></span></a> Aristotle,
while he held the permanence of the pure thinking principle
after death, had given little countenance to the hope of a
separate conscious personality. And the later Peripatetics,
like Alexander Aphrodisias, had gone farther even than
their master in dogmatic denial of immortality.<a id="noteref_2592" name="noteref_2592" href="#note_2592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2592</span></span></a> Whatever
support the instinctive craving of humanity for prolonged
existence could obtain from philosophy was offered by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Platonic and Neo-Pythagorean schools. And their influence
grew with the growing tendency to a revival of faith in the
supernatural. For Plato, with his intense belief in the divine
affinity of the human spirit, must always be the great leader
of those who seek in philosophy an interpreter and a champion
of religious intuition. The Phaedo was the last consolation of
many a victim of conscription or imperial tyranny. Its fine-spun
arguments may not have been altogether convincing, as
they hardly seem to be even to the Platonic Socrates. But Plato
was not merely a dialectician, he was also a seer and a poet.
And, on a subject so dim as immortality, where mere intellectual
proof, it is generally recognised, can be no more than
tentative and precarious, men with a deep spiritual instinct have
always felt the magnetism of the poet who could clothe his
intuitions in the forms of imagination, who, from a keener sensibility
and a larger vision, could give authority and clearness
to the spiritual intuitions of the race.<a id="noteref_2593" name="noteref_2593" href="#note_2593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2593</span></span></a> The philosophy of the
Porch gave to the Antonine age some of its loftiest characters.
But it was not the philosophy of the future. It was too cold,
and too self-centred. It had too little warmth of sympathy
with religious instincts which were becoming more and more
imperious. Although, as we have seen in Seneca, it was softened
by elements borrowed from Platonic sources, in Epictetus and
M. Aurelius, in spite of a rare spiritual elevation, it displays
the old aloofness from the mass of men, and a cold temperance
of reserve on the great question of the future of the soul.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There can be little doubt that in the last age of the Republic
a negative philosophy conspired with a decaying religious sense
to stifle the hope of immortality among the cultivated class.
Lucretius was certainly not a solitary member of his order.
His great poem, by its combination of dialectic subtlety, poetic
charm, and lofty moral earnestness, may have made many
converts to its withering creed. In the debate on the fate of
the Catilinarian conspirators, Julius Caesar could assert, without
fear of contradiction or disapproval, that death was the final
term alike of joy and sorrow in human life.<a id="noteref_2594" name="noteref_2594" href="#note_2594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2594</span></span></a> This philosophy,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a name="Pg502" id="Pg502" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>indeed, was waning in force in the time of Augustus, and its
forces were spent before the close of the first century. Yet
the elder Pliny, who saw the reign of Vespasian, inveighs
almost fiercely against the vanity or madness which dreams of
a phantom life beyond the tomb, and robs of its great charm
the last kindly boon of nature.<a id="noteref_2595" name="noteref_2595" href="#note_2595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2595</span></span></a> Seneca on this, as on many
other questions of high moment, is not steady and consistent.
In moments of spiritual exaltation he is filled with apocalyptic
rapture at the vision of an eternal world. At other times he
speaks with a cold resignation, which seems to have been the
fashion with men of his class and time, at the possibility of
extinction in death. To the toil-worn spirit, weary of the
travail and disappointments of life, death will be a quiet haven
of rest.<a id="noteref_2596" name="noteref_2596" href="#note_2596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2596</span></span></a> The old terrors of Charon and Cerberus, of the

horrors, death, being the loss of consciousness, must be the
negation of pain and desire and fear. It is, in fact, a return
to the nothingness from which we come, which has left
no memory. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Non miser potest esse qui nullus est.</span></span><a id="noteref_2598" name="noteref_2598" href="#note_2598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2598</span></span></a> The
literary men and men of the world in the age of the Flavians,
like their successors ever since, probably occupied themselves
little with a problem so long debated and so variously solved.
Quintilian treats the question of the existence of the disembodied
spirit as an open one for dialectical debate.<a id="noteref_2599" name="noteref_2599" href="#note_2599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2599</span></span></a> Tacitus,
at once credulous and sceptical, is no clearer on the subject of
immortality than he is on the subject of miracles, or omens, or
Providence. In his eulogy on Agricola he expresses a faint,
pious hope of eternal peace for his hero, if there is a place in
some other world for pious shades, and the sages are right
in thinking that great souls do not perish with the body.<a id="noteref_2600" name="noteref_2600" href="#note_2600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2600</span></span></a>
This is a very guarded and hypothetical hope; and, probably,
the only immortality for his friend in which Tacitus had much
confidence was the undying fame with which the pen of
genius can invest its subject. Tacitus, like so many of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a name="Pg503" id="Pg503" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>class, had the old Roman distrust of philosophy, and the
philosophies of which men of his generation had a tincture
had no very confident or comforting message about the soul’s
eternal destiny.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hadrian, the most interesting of the emperors, was probably
a sceptic on this as on all kindred subjects. The
greatest practical genius in the imperial line had, in the field
of religion and speculation, an infinite passion for all that was
curious and exotic.<a id="noteref_2601" name="noteref_2601" href="#note_2601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2601</span></span></a> Tramping at the head of his legions
through his world-wide domains, he relieved the tedium of
practical administration by visiting the scenes of historic
fame or the homes of ancient religion both in the East and
West. The East particularly attracted him by its infinite
fecundity of superstition. He came to see whether there was
anything in these revelations of the unseen world; he went
away to mock at them. His insatiable curiosity had an endless
variety of moods, and offered an open door to all the influences
from many creeds. The restorer of ancient shrines, the
admirer of Epictetus, the dabbler in astrology, the votary of
Eleusis<a id="noteref_2602" name="noteref_2602" href="#note_2602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2602</span></span></a> and all the mysteries of the East, the munificent

man who delighted also to puzzle and ridicule them,<a id="noteref_2603" name="noteref_2603" href="#note_2603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2603</span></span></a> had
probably few settled convictions of his own. His last words
to his soul, in their mingled lightness and pathos, seem to
express rather regret for the sunlight left behind than any
hope in entering on a dim journey into the unknown.

The Antonine age was for the masses an age of growing
faith, and yet three or four of its greatest minds, men who
had drunk deep of philosophy, or who had a rare spiritual
vision, either denied or doubted the last hope of humanity.

Epictetus is an example of a profoundly religious mind, to
whom personal immortality is not a necessity of his religion.
The great law of life is glad submission to the will of God, to
the universal order. Death, as an event which is bound to
come soon or late, should be regarded without fear. The
tremors it excites are like the shuddering of children at a tragic
mask of Gorgon or Fury. Turn the mask, and the terror is
gone.<a id="noteref_2610" name="noteref_2610" href="#note_2610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2610</span></span></a> For what is death? A separation of soul and body,
a dissolution of our frame into the kindred elements.<a id="noteref_2611" name="noteref_2611" href="#note_2611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2611</span></span></a> The

which you come. You will not exist, but you will be something
else of which the world now has need, just as you came
into your present existence when the world had need of you.
God sent you here subject to death, to live on earth a little
while in the flesh, to do His will and serve His purpose, and
join in the spectacle and festival. But the spectacle for you
is ended; go hence whither He leads, with adoration and gratitude
for all that you have seen and heard. Make room for
others who have yet to be born in accordance with His will.<a id="noteref_2613" name="noteref_2613" href="#note_2613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2613</span></span></a>
Language like this seems to give slight hope of any personal,
conscious life beyond the grave. Epictetus, like the pious
Hebrew of many of the Psalms, seems to be satisfied with
the present vision of God, whether or not there be any fuller
vision beyond the veil. Yet he elsewhere uses almost Platonic
language, which seems to imply that the soul has a separate
life, that it is a prisoner for a time in the bonds of the flesh,
and that it passes at death to the kindred source from which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a name="Pg505" id="Pg505" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it sprang.<a id="noteref_2614" name="noteref_2614" href="#note_2614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2614</span></span></a> Yet even here the hope of an individual immortality,
of any future reproduction on a higher scale of the life
on earth, need not be implied; it is indeed probably absent.
It is enough for the profoundly religious spirit of Epictetus that
God calls us; whither He calls us must be left to His will.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Galen the physician shows a similar detachment from
the ordinary hopes of humanity as to a future life, although
it springs from a very different environment and training
from those of Epictetus. Born in the reign of Hadrian,
and dying in the reign of Septimius Severus, Galen represents
the religious spirit of the Antonine age in his firm belief
in a spiritual Power and Providence.<a id="noteref_2615" name="noteref_2615" href="#note_2615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2615</span></span></a> But in philosophy
he was an eclectic of the eclectics. His medical studies
began at the age of seventeen. The influence of the Platonist,
Albinus of Smyrna, above all his stay at Alexandria, while
they gave him a wide range of sympathy, account for
the mingled and heterogeneous character of his philosophic
creed, which contains elements from every system except that
of Epicurus.<a id="noteref_2616" name="noteref_2616" href="#note_2616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2616</span></span></a> The result is a curious hesitation and equipoise
between conflicting opinions on the greatest questions. He is
particularly uncertain as to the nature of the soul and its
relation to the body. The Platonic doctrine that the soul is
an immaterial essence, independent of corporeal support, seems
to Galen very disputable. How can immaterial essences have
any separate individuality? How can they diffuse themselves
over a corporeal frame and alter and excite it, as in lunacy
or drunkenness? And again, if the Peripatetic doctrine be
true, that the soul is the <span class="tei tei-q">“form”</span> of the body, we are soon
landed in the Stoic materialism from which Galen shrank.
The soul will become, as in the well-known theory refuted in
the Phaedo,<a id="noteref_2617" name="noteref_2617" href="#note_2617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2617</span></span></a> a <span class="tei tei-q">“temperament”</span> of bodily states, and its superior
endurance, its immortality, will become a baseless dream. On
these great questions the cautious man of science will not
venture to come to any dogmatic conclusion.<a id="noteref_2618" name="noteref_2618" href="#note_2618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2618</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Galen came to Rome in the year 164, at the beginning of
the reign of M. Aurelius. He soon rose to great fame in his
profession, and when, in 168, he had returned to his native
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a name="Pg506" id="Pg506" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Pergamum, he was recalled by the emperors to meet them at
Aquileia. It was an anxious time. It was the second year
of the campaign against the Marcomanni, and the legions,
returning with Verus from the East, had brought with them
the taint of a pestilence which spread a desolation throughout
Italy from which it did not recover for ages. The slaves
were called to arms as in the Punic invasion, along with the
gladiators, and even the brigands of Dalmatia, and the massing
of the forces on the Adriatic only concentrated the malignity
of the plague.<a id="noteref_2619" name="noteref_2619" href="#note_2619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2619</span></span></a> Galen remained with the army for some
time, lending his skill to mitigate the horrors of the disease.
He returned to Rome in 170, and was left there in charge of
the youthful Commodus. The philosophic Emperor and his
philosophic physician must have often met in those dreadful
years. And we may be sure, from the detachment of
M. Aurelius, that their conversations would take a wider
range than the sanitary arrangements of the camp. With
death in the air, how could two such men, trained under such
masters, fail to question one another as to the sequel of death?
At any rate the fact remains that M. Aurelius on this question
is as submissive as Epictetus, as hesitating as Galen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Aurelius is commonly spoken of as realising Plato’s
dream of the philosopher on the throne. And yet the
description is, without some additions and explanations, somewhat
misleading. Philosopher, in the large speculative sense,
he certainly is not in his Meditations. For the infinite
curiosity of intellect, the passion to pierce the veil of the
unknown, to build a great cosmic system, he seems to have
had but little sympathy.<a id="noteref_2620" name="noteref_2620" href="#note_2620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2620</span></span></a> His is the crowning instance of
philosophy leaving the heights and concentrating itself on conduct,
which becomes not merely <span class="tei tei-q">“three-fourths of life,”</span> but the
whole, and his philosophy is really a religion. It is a religion
because it is founded on the great principle of unquestioning,
uncomplaining submission to the will of God, the law of the
whole universe. It is a religion because the repellent and
rigorous teaching of the older Stoicism is, as it is in Epictetus,
suffused with a glow of emotion.<a id="noteref_2621" name="noteref_2621" href="#note_2621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2621</span></span></a> And yet this religion, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>makes such immense demands on human nature, cuts itself off
from any support in the hope of a future life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the subject of immortality, indeed, M. Aurelius sometimes
seems to waver. He puts the question hypothetically,
or he suggests immortality as an alternative to extinction
at death. <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou goest indeed to another life, there is no
want of gods, not even there. But if to a state without
sensation, thou wilt cease to be held by pains and pleasures,
and to be a slave to the vessel.”</span><a id="noteref_2622" name="noteref_2622" href="#note_2622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2622</span></span></a> In one doubtful passage he
speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“the time when the soul shall fall out of this
envelop, like the child from the womb.”</span><a id="noteref_2623" name="noteref_2623" href="#note_2623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2623</span></span></a> He does not dogmatise
on a subject so dark. But his favourite conception
of death is that of change, of transformation, of dissolution
into the original elements. An Infinite Spirit, of which the
individual soul is an emanation, pervades the universe, and at
death the finite spirit is reabsorbed by the Infinite.<a id="noteref_2624" name="noteref_2624" href="#note_2624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2624</span></span></a> With this
is coupled the doctrine of the dark Ephesian philosophy, which
through Platonism had a profound influence on later thought.
Life is but a moment of consciousness in the unresting flow of
infinite mutation;<a id="noteref_2625" name="noteref_2625" href="#note_2625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2625</span></span></a> it is a dream, a mere vapour, the sojourn of
a passing stranger. And the last thought of Aurelius probably
was that there was no place for a hope of separate conscious
existence after the last mortal change. Soul and body alike
are swept along the stream of perpetual transformation, and
this particular <span class="tei tei-q">“ego,”</span> with all its dreams and memories, will
never re-emerge in a separate personality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Aurelius, from the frequency with which he returns to
the subject, seems fully conscious of the instinctive passion
for continued life. But he refuses to recognise it as original
and legitimate, and therefore demanding some account to be
given of it.<a id="noteref_2626" name="noteref_2626" href="#note_2626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2626</span></span></a> Still less would he ever dream of erecting it, as
Cicero and Plutarch did, into a powerful argument for some
corresponding satisfaction in another world. It is simply one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg 508]</span><a name="Pg508" id="Pg508" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the irrational appetites, a form of rebellion against the
universal order, which must be crushed and brought into submission
to inexorable law.  Neither do we find in M. Aurelius
any feeling of the need for a rectification of the injustices of
time, for any sphere for the completion of ineffectual lives,
where the crooked may be made straight and the perverted
be restored. He has, apparently, no sympathy with the sadness
so often felt by the noblest minds, at having to go hence with
so little done, so little known. The philosopher seems to have
no wish to explore in some coming life the secrets of the
universe, to prolong under happier conditions the endless quest
of the ideal in art and knowledge and thought, which seems so
cruelly baffled by the shortness of the life here below. The
affectionate father and husband and friend seems to have no
dream of any reunion with kindred souls. Above all, this
intensely religious and devout spirit seems to have no conception,
such as sometimes flashes on the mind of Seneca and of
Plutarch, of a future beatitude in the full vision of God.
This austere renunciation, if it was deliberate, of feelings and
hopes so dear to humanity, excites a certain admiration, as
the result of a stern self-discipline. It is the resignation
of what are thought to be mere fond, self-flattering fancies
in the cold light of truth, and, as such, it must ever command
a reverent respect. Yet how completely the renunciation
cuts off M. Aurelius from the spiritual movement of his time,
from the great onward sweep of humanity to a spiritual
reconstruction!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The attitude of M. Aurelius to the instinctive longing for
immortality is partly dictated by logical loyalty to the fundamental
principles of his theory of life, partly by personal
temperament and sad experience. The cosmic theory of
Heraclitus, the infinite flux of cyclic change, left little ground
for faith in the permanence of consciousness. The Stoic
principle of submission to the law of the whole made it a duty
to acquiesce calmly, or even cheerfully, in what has been
ordained for us. The whole duty, the sole blessedness of man,
lie in bringing his will into conformity with the Eternal
Reason, and in moulding this brief mundane life into a slight
counterpart of the order of the mighty world. From one
point of view the single human life is infinitely small, a mere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>point in infinite age,<a id="noteref_2627" name="noteref_2627" href="#note_2627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2627</span></span></a> agitated by hopes and fears which are
mere flitting dreams of a momentary consciousness. Nay,
the grandest features of its earthly home shrink to mean
proportions before the eye of reason. Asia is a mere corner,
the sea a drop, Athos a tiny clod in the universe.<a id="noteref_2628" name="noteref_2628" href="#note_2628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2628</span></span></a> Life is so
little a thing that death is no evil.<a id="noteref_2629" name="noteref_2629" href="#note_2629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2629</span></span></a> Yet, looked at on another
side, the daemon, the divine spark within each of us, may, by
its irresistible power, create a moral whole in each human
spirit which, during its short space of separate being, may

This is the ideal view of an austere creed, with a grandeur
of its own which all generations of the West have agreed to
venerate. But the temperament and the history of M. Aurelius
had also their share in shaping his views of life and death.
With infinite charity, indulgence, and even love for his fellows,
he was a pessimist about human life.<a id="noteref_2634" name="noteref_2634" href="#note_2634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2634</span></span></a> He had good excuse

with good cause. The horizon was darkened with ominous
thunder-clouds. The internal forces of the Empire were becoming
paralysed by a mysterious weakness. The dim hordes beyond
the Danube had descended with a force only to be repelled in
many weary campaigns. Famine and pestilence were inflicting
worse horrors than the Marcomanni. It was the beginning of
the end, although the end was long deferred. The world was
growing sad; but there was no sadder man than the saintly
Stoic on the throne, who had not only to face the Germans on
the Danube, and bear the anxieties of solitary power, but who
had to endure the keener anguish of a soul which saw the
spiritual possibilities of human nature, but also all its littleness
and baseness. The Emperor needed all the lessons of self-discipline
and close-lipped resignation which he had painfully
learnt for himself, and which he has taught to so many generations.
There have been few nobler souls, yet few more hopeless.
Like the arch mocker of the time, although from a very

transient pleasures and triumphs, ending in dust and oblivion.<a id="noteref_2635" name="noteref_2635" href="#note_2635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2635</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even in heathendom, long before M. Aurelius was born,
the drift of thought towards the goal of a personal immortality
was strong and intense. And this was only one consequence
of a movement which had profoundly affected human thought,
and had compelled Stoicism to recast itself, as in the teaching of
Seneca. Pure reason could not explain the relation of man to
the universe, it could not satisfy the deepest human instincts.
The maxim, <span class="tei tei-q">“live according to Nature,”</span> was interpreted by the
Stoic to mean a life in accordance with our own higher nature, the
Divine element within us. Yet this interpretation only brought
out the irreconcilable discordance between the two conceptions
of Nature in the physical universe and in the human spirit.
There are depths and mysteries in the one which have no
answering correspondence in the other. Something more than
reason is needed to solve the problems of human destiny, the
mysterious range of human aspiration. Nature, as a system
of cold impersonal processes, has no sympathy with man, she
may be icily indifferent or actively hostile. To conform one’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a name="Pg512" id="Pg512" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life to the supposed dictates of an abstract Reason, asserting
itself in physical laws, which seem often to make a mockery
of the noblest effort and aspiration of man, demanded a servility
of submission in human nature, and called upon it to disown a
large part of its native powers and instincts. Man, a mere
ghost of himself, attenuated to a bloodless shade, finds himself
in presence of a power cold, relentless, unmoral, according to
human standards, a power which makes holocausts of individual
lives to serve some abstract and visionary ideal of the whole.
The older Stoicism provided no object of worship. For worship
cannot be paid to an impersonal law without moral attributes.
You may in abject quietism submit to it, but you cannot revere
or adore it. It is little wonder that the Stoic sage, who could
triumph over all material obstructions by moral enthusiasm,
was sometimes exalted above the Zeus who represented mere
passionless physical law. Such an idea—for it cannot be
called a Being—has no moral import, it supplies no example,
succour, or inspiration. The sage may for a moment have
a superhuman triumph, in his defiance of the temptations
or calamities with which Nature has surrounded him, but it
is a lonely triumph of inhuman pride.<a id="noteref_2642" name="noteref_2642" href="#note_2642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2642</span></span></a> It may be the divine
element within him which has given him the victory, but this
is conceived as the mere effluence of that subtle material force
which moves under all the phenomena of physical Nature.
In surrendering yourself to the impulse of such a power you
are merely putting yourself in line with the other irrational
subjects of impersonal law. There is here, it need not be said,
no stimulus to moral life, there is the absolute negation of it.
The affinity of the human soul with the soul of the world is a
mere physical doctrine, however refined and subtle be the <span class="tei tei-q">“fiery
breath”</span> which is the common element of both. But prolonged
ethical study and analysis combined with the infiltration of
Platonism by degrees to modify profoundly the Stoic conception
of the nature of God, and of the relation of man to Him.
God tended to become more and more a person, a moral power,
a father. And the indwelling God became the voice of
conscience, consoling, prompting, supporting, inspiring an
ideal of fuller communion in another sphere. Was the
longing for continued life, in communion with kindred souls,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg 513]</span><a name="Pg513" id="Pg513" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with a Divine Spirit, which has made us what we are, to be
relegated to the limbo of anthropomorphic dreams?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seneca, as we have seen in a former chapter, still retains
some of the hard orthodoxy of the older Stoicism. In his
letters to Lucilius he occasionally uses the language of the
old Stoic materialism.<a id="noteref_2643" name="noteref_2643" href="#note_2643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2643</span></span></a> But there can be little doubt that
Seneca had assimilated other conceptions antagonistic to it.
God becomes more a Person, distinct from the world, which
He has created, which He governs, which He directs to
moral ends.<a id="noteref_2644" name="noteref_2644" href="#note_2644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2644</span></span></a> He is not merely the highest reason, He is
also the perfect wisdom, holiness, and love. He is no longer
a mere blind force or fate; He is the loving, watchful Father,
and good men are His sons. The apparent calamities which
they have to suffer are only a necessary discipline, for, <span class="tei tei-q">“whom
He loves He tries and hardens by chastisement.”</span><a id="noteref_2645" name="noteref_2645" href="#note_2645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2645</span></span></a> God can

man, Seneca has deviated even further from the creed of his
school. He appears indeed to assert sometimes that the soul
is material, but it is matter so fine and subtle as to be indistinguishable
from what we call spirit. And the ethical studies
of Seneca compelled him to abandon the Stoic doctrine of the
simple unity of the soul for the Platonic dualism, with the
opposition of reason and animal impulse. The latter has its
seat in the body, or the flesh, as he often calls it. And of the
flesh he speaks with all the contempt of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaedo</span></span>. It is a
mere shell, a fetter, a prison; or a humble hostelry which the
soul occupies only for a brief space.<a id="noteref_2647" name="noteref_2647" href="#note_2647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2647</span></span></a> With the flesh the spirit
must wage perpetual war, as the alien power which cramps its
native energies, darkens its vision, and perverts its judgment
of the truth. The true life of the spirit will, as in the theology
of Plato, only begin when the unequal partnership is dissolved.<a id="noteref_2648" name="noteref_2648" href="#note_2648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2648</span></span></a>

The orthodox Stoic doctrine allowed a limited immortality,
till the next great cosmic conflagration. But it was doubtful
whether even this continued existence was real personal life,
and with some Stoic doctors it was a privilege confined to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page514">[pg 514]</span><a name="Pg514" id="Pg514" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>greater souls.<a id="noteref_2649" name="noteref_2649" href="#note_2649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2649</span></span></a> Like nearly all philosophers of this age, Seneca
occasionally seems to admit the possibility of a return to antenatal
nothingness at death. <span class="tei tei-q">“Non potest miser esse qui nullus
est”</span> is a consolation often administered even by those who
have the hope of something better than the peace of annihilation.<a id="noteref_2650" name="noteref_2650" href="#note_2650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2650</span></span></a>
It was a consolation which might be a very real one
to men living in the reign of Nero. Taken at the worst, death
can only be dissolution, for the rivers of fire and the tortures
of Tartarus are mere figments of poetic fancy. The mind
trained in submission to universal law will not shrink from a
fate which awaits the universe by fire or cataclysmal change.
Its future fate can only be either to dwell calmly for ever
among kindred souls, or to be reabsorbed into the general
whole.<a id="noteref_2651" name="noteref_2651" href="#note_2651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2651</span></span></a> But in moments of spiritual exaltation, such an
alternative does not satisfy Seneca. He has got far beyond
the grim submission, or graceful contempt, of aristocratic suicide,
or even the faith in a bounded immortality. He has a hope
at times apparently more clear than any felt by the Platonic
Socrates on the last evening in prison. Death is no longer a
sleep, a blank peace following the futile agitations of life: it
is the gateway to eternal peace. The brief sojourn in the body
is the prelude to a longer and nobler life.<a id="noteref_2652" name="noteref_2652" href="#note_2652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2652</span></span></a> The hour, at which
you shudder as the last, is really the birthday of eternity,
when the mind, bursting from its fetters, will expatiate in
all the joy of its freedom in the light, and have unrolled
before it all the secrets and splendour of starry worlds, without
a haunting shadow.<a id="noteref_2653" name="noteref_2653" href="#note_2653"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2653</span></span></a> Nay, the vision is moralised almost in
Christian fashion. The thought of eternity compels us to think
of God as witness of every act, to remember that <span class="tei tei-q">“decisive
hour”</span> when, with all veils and disguises removed, the verdict
on our life will be pronounced. It also gives the hope of
purging away for ever the taint of the flesh and entering on
communion with the spirits of the blessed.<a id="noteref_2654" name="noteref_2654" href="#note_2654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2654</span></span></a> Thus as though
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a name="Pg515" id="Pg515" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the Eternal eyes upon him, a man should shrink from all
the baser and meaner side of his corporeal life, and so prepare
himself for the great ordeal, and the beatitude of the life to
come.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the apocalypse of Seneca a new note is struck in pagan
meditation on the immortality. We have left far behind the
thought of the Manes haunting the ancestral tomb, and soothed
in returning years by the jet of wine or the bunch of violets.
We are no longer watching, with Pindar or Virgil, the spirits
basking in Elysian meads and fanned by ocean breezes. We
are far on the way to the City of God, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cujus fundamenta in
montibus sanctis</span></span>. And indeed Seneca has probably travelled
as far towards it as any one born in heathendom ever did.
It is not wonderful that, in the fierce religious struggle of the
fourth century, his moral enthusiasm, his view of this life as a
probation for the next, his glowing vision of an almost Christian
heaven, should have suggested an imaginary intercourse with
St Paul.<a id="noteref_2655" name="noteref_2655" href="#note_2655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2655</span></span></a>

What were the influences which really moulded his
highest conception of the future state, how much was due
to a pure and vigorous spiritual intuition, how much to
Platonic and Pythagorean sources, we cannot pretend to say.
In Seneca’s most enraptured previsions of immortality, the
very exuberance of the rhetoric seems to be the expression of
intense personal feeling. But Seneca’s was a very open and
sensitive mind. One of his teachers was Sotion, who, like his
master Sextius, was called a Pythagorean, and who, on true
Pythagorean principles, taught Seneca to abstain from animal
food.<a id="noteref_2656" name="noteref_2656" href="#note_2656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2656</span></span></a> We may be sure that no Pythagorean teacher of that age
would fail to discuss with his pupil the problem of the future
life. It is true that Seneca only once or twice alludes to the
doctrine of a previous life, and he only mentions the Pythagorean
school to record the fact that in his day it was without a head.<a id="noteref_2657" name="noteref_2657" href="#note_2657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2657</span></span></a>
But that does not preclude the supposition that he may have
felt its influence in the formative years of youth. And the
Pythagoreans of the early empire were a highly eclectic school.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page516">[pg 516]</span><a name="Pg516" id="Pg516" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>They still reproduced the spirit of their founder in mathematical
symbolism, in the ideal of asceticism, in a pronounced religious
tendency.<a id="noteref_2658" name="noteref_2658" href="#note_2658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2658</span></span></a> But they had absorbed much from Platonism, as
well as from the Lyceum and the Porch. These mingled influences
also account for the profound alterations which Stoicism
had undergone in the mind of Seneca. And his contempt for
the body or the flesh, and many of the phrases in which its
cramping, lowering influences are described, savour of the
Pythagorean and Platonist schools.

prison, but it may have a very different destiny in the ages to
come, according to the manner of its earthly life. This life
and the eternal state are linked in an inevitable moral
sequence; as we sow, so shall we reap in successive lives.
There is a Great Judgment in the unseen world, with momentous,
age-long effects. The spirit which has refused to yield to the
seductions of the flesh may, in the coming life, rise to empyrean
heights beyond human imagination to picture. The soul
which has been imbruted by its environment may have to
pass a long ordeal of three thousand years, and then return
to another sojourn in human form, or it may sink hopelessly
to ever lower depths of degradation.

The biography of Apollonius of Tyana is, of course, in
one sense a romance.<a id="noteref_2672" name="noteref_2672" href="#note_2672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2672</span></span></a> Yet its tales of miracle should hardly
be allowed to obscure its value as a picture of the beliefs of
that age. We cannot doubt that the Pythagorean apostle of
the time of the Flavians went all over the Roman world,
preaching his gospel of moral and ritual purity, kindling or
satisfying the faith in the world of spirit, striving in a strange
fashion to reconcile a mystic monotheism and devotion to
a pure life of the soul with a scrupulous reverence for
all the mythologies. It may, at first sight, appear strange
that a mystic like Apollonius, of the Pythagorean school,
should so seldom allude to the subject of immortality.
The truth is that Apollonius was not a dogmatic preacher;
he dealt little in theories. His chief business, as he
conceived it, was with practical morality, and the reform or
restoration of ritual where it had fallen into desuetude and
decay.<a id="noteref_2673" name="noteref_2673" href="#note_2673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2673</span></span></a> Penetrated as he was with the faith in a spiritual
world, he seems to assume as a postulate the eternity of the
soul, and its incarnation for a brief space on earth. During
its sojourn in the flesh, it is visited by visions from on high,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg 519]</span><a name="Pg519" id="Pg519" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and such revelations are vouchsafed in proportion to its
ascetic purity.<a id="noteref_2674" name="noteref_2674" href="#note_2674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2674</span></span></a> What conception of the life to come Apollonius
entertained we cannot say; but its reality to him was a self-evident
truth. We are surrounded by the spirits of the
departed, although we know it not. Sailing among the islands
of the Aegean, he once gratified his disciples by the tale of
his having met the shade of Achilles at his tomb in the Troad.<a id="noteref_2675" name="noteref_2675" href="#note_2675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2675</span></span></a>
Men said that the hero was really dead, and in the old home
of the Myrmidons, his worship was forgotten. But Apollonius,
in a prayer which he had learnt from the sages on the
Ganges, called upon the heroic shade to dispel all doubts by
appearing at his call. At once an earthquake shook the tomb,
and a fair youthful form was by his side of wondrous beauty
and superhuman stature, clothed in a Thessalian mantle. His
stature grew more majestic, and his beauty more glorious as
Apollonius gazed. But the sage had no weak fears in the
presence even of so august a spirit, and pressed him with
questions which savour far more of antiquarian than spiritual
interest. Was Helen really in Troy? Why does not Homer
mention Palamedes? The hero resolved his doubts, sent a
warning message to the Thessalians to restore his forgotten
honours, and in a soft splendour vanished at the first cock-crow.<a id="noteref_2676" name="noteref_2676" href="#note_2676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2676</span></span></a>

The biography of Apollonius closes with a tale which
throws a strong light on the spiritual cravings of that age.

his death, the youth of Tyana were much occupied with
solemn thoughts. But there was a sceptic among them who
had vainly besought the departed philosopher to return from

suddenly started up as one demented, with the cry—<span class="tei tei-q">“I believe
thee.”</span> Then he told his friends that he had seen the spirit of
the sage, that he had been actually among them, though they
knew it not, chanting a marvellous song of life and death. It
told of the escape of the soul from the mouldering frame and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of its swift flight to ethereal worlds. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt know all

The new Platonist school, with Plutarch and Maximus at
their head, were, in this age, the great apostles of the hope of
immortality. Platonists in their theory of mind and God, Neo-Pythagorean
in their faith in the openness of the human
spirit at its best to supernatural influences, they felt the
doctrine of the coming life to be axiomatic. It is true that
the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Consolation to Apollonius</span></span>, seems at times to
waver, as Seneca did, between the idea of extinction at death
and the hope of eternal beatitude.<a id="noteref_2679" name="noteref_2679" href="#note_2679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2679</span></span></a> This piece is full of
pessimist thoughts of life, and embalms many a sad saying of
the Greek poets on its shortness and its misery.<a id="noteref_2680" name="noteref_2680" href="#note_2680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2680</span></span></a> Bringing
far more sorrow than joy, life may well be regarded as a
mysterious punishment. That Thracian tribe which mourned
at each birth as others do at death, had a true philosophy of
man’s estate. The great consolation is that, in the phrase of
Heraclitus, death and life are one, we are dying every moment
from our birth. Death is the great healer, in the words of
Aeschylus, the deliverer from the curse of existence, whether it
be an eternal sleep or a far journey into an unknown land.
The prospect of blank nothingness offers no terrors; for the
soul only returns to its original unconsciousness. But this
was hardly a congenial mood to the author, and before the close,
he falls back on the solace of mystic tradition or poetic vision,
that, for the nobler sort, there is a place prepared in the ages
to come, after the Great Judgment, when all souls, naked and
stripped of all trappings and disguises, shall have to answer
for the deeds done in the body.<a id="noteref_2681" name="noteref_2681" href="#note_2681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2681</span></span></a> The same faith is professed
by Plutarch to his wife in the Consolation on the death of
their little daughter, which took place while Plutarch was from
home. The loss of a pure bright young soul, full of love and
kindness to all, even to her lifeless toys, was evidently a heavy
blow.<a id="noteref_2682" name="noteref_2682" href="#note_2682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2682</span></span></a> But Plutarch praises his wife’s simple restraint and
abstinence from the effusive parade of conventional mourning.
All such displays seemed to him a rather vulgar intemperance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a name="Pg521" id="Pg521" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and self-indulgence.<a id="noteref_2683" name="noteref_2683" href="#note_2683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2683</span></span></a> And why grieve for one who is spared
all grief? She had her little joys, and, knowing no other, she
suffers no pain of loss. Yet Plutarch would not have his wife
accept the cold consolation that death brings unconsciousness.
He reminds her of the brighter, more cheering vision which
they have enjoyed together as communicants in the Dionysiac
mysteries. If the soul is undying, if it is of divine parentage
and has a divine destiny, then the shortness of its imprisonment
and exile is a blessing. The captive bird may come by
use and wont actually to love its cage. And the worst misery
of old age is not grey hairs and weakness, but a dull absorption
in the carnal and forgetfulness of divine things. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom the
gods love die young.”</span> By calling them back early, they save
them from long wanderings.<a id="noteref_2684" name="noteref_2684" href="#note_2684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2684</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch’s belief in immortality is a religious faith, a
practical postulate. He nowhere discusses the bases of the
belief in an exhaustive way. It is rather inseparable from his
conception of God and His justice, and the relation of the
human soul to God.<a id="noteref_2685" name="noteref_2685" href="#note_2685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2685</span></span></a> He admits that the prospect of reward
or punishment in another world has but little influence on
men’s conduct.<a id="noteref_2686" name="noteref_2686" href="#note_2686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2686</span></span></a> Few believe in the tales of tortures of the
damned. And those who do can soothe their fears, and purchase
a gross immortality, by initiations and indulgences.<a id="noteref_2687" name="noteref_2687" href="#note_2687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2687</span></span></a>
Yet it is impossible to doubt that to Plutarch the hope of the
eternal life was a precious possession. He assails with force,
and even asperity, the Epicurean school for their attempt to rob
humanity of it, on the pretext of relieving men of a load of superstitious
fears. They are like men on board a ship who, letting
the passengers know that they have no pilot, console them with
the further information that it does not matter, as they are
bound to drive upon the rocks.<a id="noteref_2688" name="noteref_2688" href="#note_2688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2688</span></span></a> The great promise of Epicurus
was to free men from the spectral terrors with which poetic
fancy had filled the scenery of the under world. But in doing
so, he invested death with a new horror infinitely worse than
the fabled tortures of the damned. It was a subtle fallacy
which taught that, as annihilation involves the extinction of
consciousness, the lamented loss of the joys and vivid energy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a name="Pg522" id="Pg522" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of life was a mere imagination projected on a blank future
where no regret could ever disturb the tranquillity of nothingness<a id="noteref_2689" name="noteref_2689" href="#note_2689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2689</span></span></a>.
Plutarch took his stand on psychology. The passion
for continued existence is, as a matter of fact, the most imperious
in our nature. With the belief in immortality, Epicurus
sweeps away the strongest and dearest hopes of the mass of
men. This life is indeed full of pain and sorrow; yet men
cling to it passionately, merely as life, in the darkest hours.
And they are ready to brave the worst horrors of Cerberus
and Chimaera for the chance of continued existence.<a id="noteref_2690" name="noteref_2690" href="#note_2690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2690</span></span></a> The
privation of a dream of happiness in another world is a real
loss, even though, when the grey day of nothingness dawns,
the consciousness of loss be gone. Is it a light thing to tell
the nobler spirits, the moral athletes, who have battled with
evil all life long, that they have been contending for a visionary
crown?<a id="noteref_2691" name="noteref_2691" href="#note_2691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2691</span></span></a> Is it nothing to the idealist who, amid all the
obstructions of the life in the flesh, has been fostering his
nobler powers, in the hope of eternal freedom and the full
vision of truth, that that real life to which he fancied
death was only the gateway is, after all, a mere illusion?
Nor does Plutarch disdain to take account of that vivacity of
love which in all ages has sought to soften the bitterness
of parting by the hope of reunion and recognition in other
worlds.<a id="noteref_2692" name="noteref_2692" href="#note_2692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2692</span></span></a>

felt that the full assurance of the long dream of humanity lies
beyond the veil—that we know not what we shall be. And,
like the master, he invoked the apocalyptic power of the
religious and poetic imagination to fortify the hesitating
conclusions of the reason.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The visionary power and charm of the great master, whose
reign was to be prolonged for ages after Plutarch’s time, is seen,
perhaps in a faint reflection, in Plutarch’s mythical forecast of
the future of the soul. Plato’s psychology, his sharp opposition
of the reason to the lower nature rooted in the flesh, his
vision of the Eternal Goodness, his intensely moral conception
of the responsibility of life on earth, its boundless possibilities
of future unimpeded intuition, its possible eternal degradation
through ages of cyclic change, all this, together with kindred
elements, perhaps from the Semitic east, had left a profound
effect on religious minds. The greatness of S. Augustine is
nowhere more apparent than in his frank recognition of the
spiritual grandeur of Plato. And that great spirit, so agile in
dialectic subtlety, so sublime in its power of rising above the
cramping limitations of our mortal life, is also, from its vivid
poetic sympathy, most ready to aid weak ordinary souls to
climb <span class="tei tei-q">“the altar stairs.”</span> Never was pure detached intelligence
wedded so harmoniously to glowing imagination, never was
ethereal truth so clothed in the warm colouring and splendour
of the world of sense. Where reason has strained its utmost
strength to solve the eternal riddle, ecstatic vision and religious
myth, transcending the limits of space and time, must be called
in to lend their aid.

or four he recognised, and would have spoken to them, but they
seemed delirious or senseless, and shrank away from him, forming
in the end little companies of their own, who swept along in
wild disordered movements, uttering strange cries of wailing or
terror. The soul of an old acquaintance then hailed him and
became his guide, pointing out that the souls of the really dead
cast no shadow, being perfectly pellucid, surrounded by light.
Yet some of them are marked with scales and weals and
blotches. Adrasteia is the inevitable judge of all, and, through
three ministers, three great classes of criminals receive their
proper doom. Some are punished swiftly on earth, another
class meet with heavier judgment in the shades. The utterly
incurable are ruthlessly pursued by the Erinnys, and finally
plunged in a dark abyss, of which the horrors might not be
told. The second class undergo a fierce purgatorial cleansing, in
which some spirits have all their stains wiped out and become
clear and lustrous. But where evil is more obstinate, and
passion again and again asserts its power, the soul long retains
a colour appropriate to its peculiar vice. The mean avaricious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page525">[pg 525]</span><a name="Pg525" id="Pg525" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>soul is dark and squalid; the cruel is blood-red; the envious

Thespesius and his guide are then swept on wings of
light to other and less gloomy scenes. Over the chasm of
Forgetfulness, clothed in its recesses with flowers and herbs
which exhale a fragrant odour, the opening through which
Dionysus had passed to his place among the gods, floated a
cloud of spirits like birds, drinking in the fragrance with
mirth and gladness. On again they passed, till they came to
a crater which received the flow of many-coloured streams,
snow-white or rainbow-hued,<a id="noteref_2702" name="noteref_2702" href="#note_2702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2702</span></span></a> and hard by was the oracle of
Night and Selene, from which issue dreams and phantoms to
wander among men. Then Thespesius was dazzled with the
radiance which shot from the Delphic tripod upwards to the
peaks of Parnassus; and, blinded by the radiance, he could
only hear the shrill voice of a woman chanting a song which
seemed to tell of the hour of his own death. The woman, his
guide explained, was the Sibyl who dwells on the face of the
moon. The sweep of the moon’s onward course prevented
him catching the Sibyl’s words to the full, but he heard a
prophecy of the desolation of Campania by the fires of Vesuvius,
and the death of the emperor.

Other scenes of punishment follow, among which Thespesius
saw his own father rising from the abyss, covered with weals
and marks of torture which had been inflicted for a long-buried
crime. Finally, the friendly guide vanished, and
Thespesius was forced onwards by dread spectral forms to
witness fresh scenes of torment. The hypocrite who had
hidden his vices under a veil of decorum was forced, with
infinite pain of contortion, to turn out his inmost soul. The
avaricious were plunged by daemons by turns in three lakes,
one of boiling gold, one of freezing lead, and one of hardest
iron. But the worst fate of all was reserved for those whose
sins had been visited on their innocent descendants upon
earth, who pursued them with curses, or clung around them

The vision of Timarchus, in the piece on the Genius of
Socrates, has a rather different motive from that which inspired
the vision of Thespesius. Thespesius came back with a
message as to the endless consequences of sin in worlds
beyond the senses, and the far-reaching responsibilities of
the life on earth. The experiences of Timarchus in the
cave of Trophonius were intended to teach the doctrine of
the existence, apart from the lower powers akin to fleshly
nature, of the pure intelligence or daemon, which, coming
from the Divine world, can catch its voices and transmit
them to the mortal life here below. Timarchus made the
descent into the cave of Trophonius and spent in its weird
darkness two nights and a day, during which he saw a wondrous
revelation of the spirit-world.<a id="noteref_2704" name="noteref_2704" href="#note_2704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2704</span></span></a> His higher part, escaping

An unseen guide explained to him the fourfold division of the
universe and the boundaries of its provinces. High above all
is the sphere of the One and the Invisible. Next in order is
the region of pure mind, of which the Sun is lord. The third
is the debatable land between pure intelligence and the sensible
and mortal—the region of soul, whose mistress is the moon.
Styx is the boundary between this lunar kingdom and the low
world of matter, sin, and death. The three realms beneath
the highest correspond to the three elements of our composite
nature,—mind, soul, and body.<a id="noteref_2706" name="noteref_2706" href="#note_2706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2706</span></span></a> This mortal life is a temporary
and unequal partnership of the Divine reason with the lower

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg 527]</span><a name="Pg527" id="Pg527" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The first, imperfect and incomplete, is the severance of soul
from body in what men call death, the falling away of the
gross wrappings of matter. This death is under the sway of
Demeter. The second, under the care of Persephone, is a
slower process, in which the ethereal reason, the true eternal
personality of man, is finally released from association with
the passionate and sensitive nature, which is akin to the bodily
organism. After the first corporeal death, all souls wander
for a time in the space between the moon and earth. In
the vision of Timarchus, he saw over the chasm of darkness
a host of stars with a curious variety of motion. Some
shot up from the gulf with a straight decided impetus.
Others wavered in deflexions to right or left, or, after an
upward movement, plunged again into the abyss. These
motions, as the invisible guide expounded, represent the
various tendencies of souls, corresponding to the strength or
weakness of the spiritual force within them. All souls have
an element of the Divine reason, but it is variously blended
with the baser elements in different natures. In some it
becomes completely sunk and absorbed in the life of the
senses. In others, the rational part holds itself above the
lower bodily life, and maintains an almost separate existence.
And yet there are natures in which the rational
and irrational elements wage a long and indecisive conflict
until, slowly, at last, the passions recognise their rightful
master, and become obedient to the heavenly voice within.
The debased and hopeless souls, rising for a moment after
death, are repelled with fierce angry flashes by the moon,
and fall back again to the world of sense and corruption, to
undergo a second birth. The purer souls are received by her
for a loftier destiny. In some, the pure spiritual part is finally
released by the love of the Sun from the lower powers of the
soul, which wither and fade away as the body does on earth.
Others, still retaining the composite nature, though no longer
tainted by the flesh, dwell in the moon as daemons, but often
revisit the earth on various missions, to furnish inspiration to
oracles and mysteries, to save men from crime or to punish,
to help the struggling by land or sea. But even the daemons
may fall from their high estate. If, in their duties of providence
and succour, they show anger or favour or envy, they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page528">[pg 528]</span><a name="Pg528" id="Pg528" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may be thrust down once more into the purgatory of material
form.<a id="noteref_2707" name="noteref_2707" href="#note_2707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2707</span></span></a>

It may well be that the unsympathetic critic will regard
such an imaginative invasion of the unseen as a freak of
lawless fancy, hardly worth chronicling. And like all similar
attempts, the apocalypse of Plutarch may easily be treated
with an airy ridicule. To a more serious criticism, it seems
vitiated by a radical inconsistency. Starting with the principle
of the absolutely immaterial nature of the immortal part of
man, it yet depicts its future existence in the warmest colours
of the world of sense. Its struggles, its tortures, its beatitude
are described in terms which might seem fitting only to a
corporeal nature. All this is true; and yet the answer which
Plutarch would probably have made to any such cavils is very
simple. How can you speak of pure disembodied spirit at all,
how can you imagine it, save in the symbolism of ordinary
speech? Refine and subtilise your language to the very
uttermost, and it will still retain associations and reminiscences,
however faint and distant, of the material world. Myth and
symbol are necessary to any expression of human thought
alike about God and the future of the soul. The Infinite
Spirit and the future destiny of the finite, which is His child,
are equally beyond the range of human sense and speech.
When the human spirit has exhausted all its efforts of
imagination to pierce the darkness of the world beyond the
grave, it takes refuge in some religious system which claims
to have a divine message and speaks in the tones of another
world. The voice from eternity came to troubled heathendom
from Egypt and the East.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is well known that, from the second Punic War to the
revival of Augustus, old Roman religion was falling into
decay. Yet sweeping assertions about the religious condition
of any age must he taken with some reserve. They are
often unsafe about a contemporary society; they must be still
more so with regard to a society which is known to us almost
entirely through the literary remains of a comparatively small
cultivated class. Even among that limited circle, we can
know only the opinions of a few, and hardly anything of its
silent members, still less of the feelings of its women and
dependents. A deep shadow rests on those remote granges
and quiet country towns in Samnium or Lombardy where
character remained untainted in the days of Nero or Domitian,
and where the religion of Numa long defied the penal edicts of
Theodosius and Honorius. Lucretius, whose mission it was to
liberate men from the terrors of old Latin and Etrurian superstition,
was not contending against an imaginary foe. The
sombre enthusiasm which he throws into the conflict reveals
the strength of the enemy. The grandmother of Atticus and
Terentia, the wife of Cicero, were timorous devotees. Among
the aristocratic augurs of Cicero’s day there were firm believers
in the sacred birds; and Lentulus, a confederate of Catiline,
trusted implicitly in the oracles of the Sibyl.<a id="noteref_2708" name="noteref_2708" href="#note_2708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2708</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still there can be no doubt that in the governing and thinking
class of the last century of the Republic, scepticism and
even open contempt for the old religion were rampant. Many
causes were at work to produce this decadence of old Roman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page530">[pg 530]</span><a name="Pg530" id="Pg530" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>faith. It was hardly possible for the cultivated Roman of the
days of Scipio Aemilianus, or of Cicero and Caesar, who had
fought and travelled in many lands, and studied their
mythologies and philosophies, to acquiesce in the faith of the
simple farmers of Latium, who founded the Ambarvalia and
Lupercalia, who offered the entrails of a dog to Robigus<a id="noteref_2709" name="noteref_2709" href="#note_2709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2709</span></span></a> and
milk to Pales and Silvanus, who worshipped Jupiter Feretrius
under the mountain oak.<a id="noteref_2710" name="noteref_2710" href="#note_2710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2710</span></span></a> Since those far-off days, Latium
had come under many influences, and added many new deities
to her pantheon. The gods of Hellas had come to be identified
with the gods of Rome, or to share their honours. Syncretism
had been at work in Italy centuries before the days of Plutarch
and Aristides. And the old Italian deities, who had only a
shadowy personality, with no poetry of legend to invest them
with human interest, melted into one another or into forms of alien
mythology. Greek literature became familiar to the educated
from the Hannibalic war, and a writer like Euripides, who had
a great popularity, must have influenced many by the audacious
skill with which he lowered the dignity and dimmed the
radiance of the great figures of Greek legend. The comic
stage improved upon the lesson. Early in the second century
Ennius translated the Sacred Histories of Euhemerus, and
familiarised his countrymen with a theory which reduced
Jupiter and Saturn, Faunus and Hercules, to the stature of
earthly kings and warriors. But Greek philosophy was the
great solvent of faith. The systems of the New Academy and
Epicurus were openly or insidiously hostile to religious belief.
But they had not so long and powerful a reign over the Roman
mind as Stoicism, and, although the earlier Stoicism extended
a philosophic patronage to popular religion, it may be doubted
whether it stimulated faith. There was indeed a certain
affinity between Stoical doctrine and old Roman religion, as
there was between Stoic morals and old Roman character. In
resolving the gods by allegory and pseudo-scientific theory into
various potencies of the great World-Soul, the follower of Zeno
did not seem to do much violence to the vaguely personified
abstractions of the old Latin creed. Above all, with the exception
of Panaetius, the Stoic doctors did not throw doubt
on the powers of divination and augury, so essential an element
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a name="Pg531" id="Pg531" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the religion of Rome. The power to read the future was a
natural corollary to the providence and benevolence of the
gods.<a id="noteref_2711" name="noteref_2711" href="#note_2711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2711</span></span></a> Yet, although the Stoic might strive to discover the
germ of truth, he did not conceal his contempt for the husk of
mythology in which it was hidden, and for many of the practices
of worship.<a id="noteref_2712" name="noteref_2712" href="#note_2712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2712</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quintus Scaevola and Varro applied all the forces of subtle
antiquarianism and reverence to sustain the ancestral faith.
But they also drew the line sharply between the religion of
philosophy and the religion of the State. And Varro went so
far as to say that the popular religion was the creation of early
statesmen,<a id="noteref_2713" name="noteref_2713" href="#note_2713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2713</span></span></a> and that if the work had to be done again, it might
be done better in the light of philosophy. The Stoic in
Cicero, as Seneca did after him, treated the tales of the gods
as mere anile superstition.<a id="noteref_2714" name="noteref_2714" href="#note_2714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2714</span></span></a> It is probable that such was the
tone, in their retired debates, of the remarkable circle which
surrounded Scipio and Laelius. Panaetius, their philosophic
guide, had less sympathy than any great Stoic with popular
theology.<a id="noteref_2715" name="noteref_2715" href="#note_2715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2715</span></span></a> Polybius gave small place to Providence in human

were enthusiastic champions of a system which they regarded
as irrational, but which was consecrated by immemorial
antiquity. Laelius defended the institutions of Numa in a
speech of golden eloquence which moved the admiration of
Cicero, just as Symmachus defended them five centuries later
before the council of Valentinian.<a id="noteref_2717" name="noteref_2717" href="#note_2717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2717</span></span></a> The divorce between
esoteric belief and official profession must have insidiously
lowered the moral tone of those who were at once thinkers
and statesmen. Such a false position struck some of the
speakers in Cicero’s theological dialogues, and it makes his own
opinions an enigma.<a id="noteref_2718" name="noteref_2718" href="#note_2718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2718</span></span></a> The external and utilitarian attitude to

conformity in the last age of the Republic. Divination and
augury had become mere engines of political intrigue, and the
aristocratic magistrate could hardly take the omens without a
smile. Varro could not repress the fear that the old religion,
on which he expended such a wealth of learning, might perish
from mere negligence.<a id="noteref_2719" name="noteref_2719" href="#note_2719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2719</span></span></a> The knowledge of liturgical usage
began to fade, and Varro had to recall the very names of
forgotten gods. An ancient priesthood of the highest rank
remained unfilled for seventy years.<a id="noteref_2720" name="noteref_2720" href="#note_2720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2720</span></span></a> Scores of the most

brotherhoods like the Titii and Fratres Arvales are hardly
heard of for generations before the reforms of the Augustan age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not within the scope of this work to enter minutely
into the subject of that great effort of reform or reaction.
It is commonly said that the cool imperial statesman had
chiefly political ends in view, and especially the aggrandisement
and security of the principate. And certainly Ovid, who
strove to interest his countrymen in the revival of their religion,
does not display much seriousness in religion or morals. He
treats as lightly the amours of Olympus as the intrigues of
the Campus Martius and the Circus. Yet it may well have
been that after the terrible orgies of civil strife through which
the Roman world had passed, Augustus was the convinced
representative of a repentant wish to return to the old paths.
The Roman character, through all wild aberrations of a trying
destiny, was an enduring type. And Augustus, if he may have
indulged in impious revels in his youth, which recall the
wanton freaks of Alcibiades,<a id="noteref_2722" name="noteref_2722" href="#note_2722"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2722</span></span></a> had two great characteristics of
the old Roman mind, formalism and superstition. He had
an infinite faith in dreams and omens. He would begin no
serious business on the Nones.<a id="noteref_2723" name="noteref_2723" href="#note_2723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2723</span></span></a> When he had to pronounce
a funeral oration over his sister, Octavia, he had a curtain
drawn before the corpse, lest the eyes of the pontiff might be
polluted by the sight of death.<a id="noteref_2724" name="noteref_2724" href="#note_2724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2724</span></span></a> We may think that his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page533">[pg 533]</span><a name="Pg533" id="Pg533" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>religious revival was not inspired by real religious sentiment.
Yet it is well to remind ourselves that old Roman religion,
while it consecrated and solemnised the scenes and acts of
human life, was essentially a formal religion; the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">opus
operatum</span></span> was the important thing. Its business was to avert
the anger or win the favour of dim unearthly powers; it was
not primarily to purify or elevate the soul. Above all, it was
interwoven from the beginning with the whole fabric of society
and the State. Four centuries after Augustus was in his
grave, it was only by a violent wrench, which inflicted infinite
torture even on pagan mystics of the Neoplatonist school, that
Rome was severed from the gods who had been the guardians
and partners of her career for twelve hundred years. The
altar of Victory which Augustus had placed in the Senate-house,
and before which twelve generations of senators after
him offered their prayers for the chief of the State, the most
sacred symbol of the pagan Empire, was only removed after a
fierce, obstinate struggle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The religious revival of Augustus may not have aroused
any deep religious sentiment; that, as we shall see, was to
come from a different source. But it gave a fresh life to the
formal religion of the State, which maintained itself till within
a few years before the invasion of Alaric. The title Augustus
which the new emperor assumed was one which, to the
Roman mind, associated him with the majesty of Jupiter and
the sanctity of all holy places and solemn rites.<a id="noteref_2725" name="noteref_2725" href="#note_2725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2725</span></span></a> It was
the beginning of that theocratic theory of monarchy which
was to culminate, under the influence of Sun-worship, in the
third century, and to propagate itself into ages far removed
from the worship of Jupiter or the Sun. Although
the counsels of Maecenas, recorded by Dion Cassius, may be
apocryphal, Augustus acted in their spirit.<a id="noteref_2726" name="noteref_2726" href="#note_2726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2726</span></span></a> As triumvir he

Juno Sospita, coeval with the Roman State, and encouraged
his friends to do the same for other venerable monuments of
devotion. The most lavish gifts of gold and jewels were
dedicated in the Capitoline temples. The precision of ancient
augury was restored. Ancient priesthoods which had been
long vacant were filled up, and the sacred colleges were raised
in dignity and wealth.<a id="noteref_2730" name="noteref_2730" href="#note_2730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2730</span></span></a> Special care was taken to recall the
vestals to the chaste dignity from which they had fallen for a
hundred years. Before taking his seat, each senator was
required to make a prayer, with an offering of incense and
wine before the altar. Three worships, specially connected
with the fortunes of Augustus or his race,—those of Venus
Genetrix, Mars Ultor, and the Palatine Apollo,—were revived
with added splendour.<a id="noteref_2731" name="noteref_2731" href="#note_2731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2731</span></span></a> The emperor paid special attention
to the ancient sacred colleges, such as the Salii and Arvales,
which went back to days far earlier than the Republic. Amid
all the cares of State, he attended their meetings punctually.
The dangerous right of co-optation was quietly withdrawn, till
the members in the end owed their appointment to the sacerdotal
chief of the State.<a id="noteref_2732" name="noteref_2732" href="#note_2732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2732</span></span></a> The colleges became the most courtly
and deferential supports of the prince’s power. Prayers for
his safety soon found a place in their antique litanies. It has
been said with some truth that the Salii and Arvales seem to
be thinking more of the emperors than of the gods. The
colleges had a courtly memory for all anniversaries in the
imperial family. The Arval brothers achieved the infamy of
complimenting Nero on his return after the murder of Agrippina,<a id="noteref_2733" name="noteref_2733" href="#note_2733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2733</span></span></a>

But it was through the chief pontificate that the emperors
did most at once to fortify and dignify their secular power,
and to prolong the reign of the old Latin religion. It was
the highest religious dignity of ancient Rome. The college of
which the emperor, as Pontifex Maximus, was head exercised
a supreme and comprehensive control over the whole field
of religion.<a id="noteref_2735" name="noteref_2735" href="#note_2735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2735</span></span></a> It was charged with the duty of maintaining

Private opinion after the Augustan revival greatly varied
as to matters of faith. Men like the elder Pliny and Seneca
scoffed at anthropomorphic religion. Men like Juvenal
and Tacitus maintained a wavering attitude, with probably a
receding faith. Others like Suetonius were rapacious collectors of
every scrap of the miraculous. The emperors who succeeded

of the Capitol, which had been burned down in the civil war,
was one of the first tasks of his reign. And the ceremony
made such an impression on the imagination of the youthful
Tacitus, that he has recorded with studied care the stately
and accurate ritual of olden time which was observed by the
emperor.<a id="noteref_2752" name="noteref_2752" href="#note_2752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2752</span></span></a> Domitian carried on the restoration on even a

Hadrian, whose character is an enigma of contrasts, to judge by
his last famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jeu d’esprit</span></span> on his death-bed, probably died a
sceptic. Yet his biographer tells us that he was a careful
guardian of the ancient ritual.<a id="noteref_2754" name="noteref_2754" href="#note_2754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2754</span></span></a> The archaistic fashion in

a scrupulous observance of ancient forms in religion.<a id="noteref_2755" name="noteref_2755" href="#note_2755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2755</span></span></a> The
genius of one too early taken away has done more than a

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page537">[pg 537]</span><a name="Pg537" id="Pg537" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>made the passing moment of vivid artistic perception the
great end of life, yet still instinct with the old Roman love

offering to the dead members of the household.<a id="noteref_2756" name="noteref_2756" href="#note_2756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2756</span></span></a> The cheerless
negation of Epicurus, and the equally withering theology
of the Stoics, could not weaken in Roman hearts the spell of
ancestral pieties which clustered round the vault near the grey
old country house of the race, looking down on the Tyrrhene
sea, or the awe of ancient grove or spring sacred to Silvanus
and the Nymphs, or the calm, chastened joy in a ritual in which
every act was dictated by a love of ceremonial cleanness and
exactness, and redolent of an immemorial past. In such a
household, and in such an atmosphere, the two great Antonines
were reared. The first, who was before all else an honest
country gentleman, fond of hunting, fishing, and the gladness
of the vintage at Lorium, never failed to perform all due
sacrifices unless he was ill. His coins bear the pictured
legends of the infancy of Rome.<a id="noteref_2757" name="noteref_2757" href="#note_2757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2757</span></span></a> M. Aurelius was famous
as a boy for his knowledge of Roman ritual. Enrolled in the
college of the Salii in his eighth year, he performed all its
sacred offices with perfect composure, reciting from memory,
with no one to dictate the form, every word of the ancient
liturgy which had in his generation become almost unintelligible.<a id="noteref_2758" name="noteref_2758" href="#note_2758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2758</span></span></a>
In the terror of the Marcomannic invasion he
delayed his departure for the seat of war to summon around
him all the priests; he had the city purified in solemn,
decorous fashion, not excluding even the rites of alien lands;
and for seven days the images of the gods were feasted on
their couches along all the streets.<a id="noteref_2759" name="noteref_2759" href="#note_2759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2759</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emperors from Augustus found religion a potent ally of
sovereignty, and the example of the master of the world was a
great force. Yet it may well be doubted whether, in the matter
of religious conservatism, the emperors were not rather following
than leading public opinion. Gods were in those times being
created by the score; apotheosis was in the air from the days of
Nero to the days of the Severi. Petronius, with an exaggeration
which has a certain foundation in fact, affirms that in Croton
you could more readily light upon a god than on a man.<a id="noteref_2760" name="noteref_2760" href="#note_2760"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2760</span></span></a> The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page538">[pg 538]</span><a name="Pg538" id="Pg538" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>elder Pliny uses almost the same strength of language. The
grumbler in Lucian indignantly complains of the fashion in
which the ancient gods of Olympus are being overshadowed by
the divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parvenus</span></span> of every clime. And, as we shall presently
see, the inscriptions reveal an immense propaganda of worships
in tone and spirit apparently hostile to the old religion of the
Latin race. Yet the inscriptions also show that the old gods
had really little to fear from the new. A survey of the index
to almost any volume of the Corpus will convince the student
that the Trinity of the Capitol,—Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva,—that
Hercules and Silvanus, the Nymphs, Semo Sancus and
Dea Dia, Mars and Fortuna, so far from being neglected, were
apparently more popular than ever.<a id="noteref_2761" name="noteref_2761" href="#note_2761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2761</span></span></a> In an age of growing
monotheism the King of the gods was, of course, still supreme

The Quinquatria of Minerva were not only celebrated with

grown in popularity under the early Empire. Hercules, the
god of plenty, strong truth, and good faith, whose legend is
intertwined with the most venerable names in Roman story,
has his altars and monuments everywhere.<a id="noteref_2768" name="noteref_2768" href="#note_2768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2768</span></span></a> Combining with
his own native Latin character the poetic prestige of his
brother of Greek legend, he became the symbol of world-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page539">[pg 539]</span><a name="Pg539" id="Pg539" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wide conquest, and was associated in the end with the triumph
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“unconquered”</span> Mithra. His image is stamped upon the
coins of some of the emperors. Septimius Severus, Caracalla,
and Diocletian took him for their great divine patron and
ensample.<a id="noteref_2769" name="noteref_2769" href="#note_2769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2769</span></span></a> Silvanus, too, the god of the primeval forest, and,
when the forest had receded, the god of the shepherd and the
farmer, the guardian of boundaries, acquired a strange vogue
in what was eminently an age of cities. One is apt, however,
to forget sometimes that it was an age which had also a charming
country life. A Roman cavalry officer in Britain has left
a memorial of his gratitude to Silvanus for the capture of a
wild boar of surpassing size and strength,<a id="noteref_2770" name="noteref_2770" href="#note_2770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2770</span></span></a> which had long
defied the hunter. In one of the forest cantons of the Alps a
procurator of the imperial estates inscribed his gratitude in
a pretty set of verses to the god of the wilds, whose image
was enshrined in the fork of a sacred ash.<a id="noteref_2771" name="noteref_2771" href="#note_2771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2771</span></span></a> It is the record
of many a day passed in lonely forest tracks, coupled with a
prayer to be restored safely to Italian fields and the gardens
of Rome. The nymphs and river gods had all their old honours.
Chapels and hostelries, in the days of Pliny, rose on the banks
of the Clitumnus, where the votaries easily combined pleasure
with religious duty. The nymphs receive votive thanks for
the discovery of hidden springs, or for the reappearance of some
fountain long dried up.<a id="noteref_2772" name="noteref_2772" href="#note_2772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2772</span></span></a> Aesculapius, who had been naturalised
in Italy since the beginning of the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, sprang
to a foremost place in the age of the Antonines. Whether it
was <span class="tei tei-q">“an age of valetudinarians,”</span> as has been said, may be
doubtful; but it was an age eagerly in quest of the health
which so often comes from the quiet mind. Whatever we
may think of the powers of the old Olympians, there can be
no doubt about the beneficent influence of the god of Epidaurus.
He was summoned to Rome 300 years before Christ, and
obtained a home in the island in the Tiber, where for ages he
gave his succour in dreams. His worship spread far and wide,
and was one of the last to succumb to the advance of the
Church.<a id="noteref_2773" name="noteref_2773" href="#note_2773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2773</span></span></a>

The unassailable permanence of the old religion may perhaps
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page540">[pg 540]</span><a name="Pg540" id="Pg540" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be still more vividly realised in the long unbroken life of
sacred colleges, such as the Salii and the Fratres Arvales. The
Arval brotherhood was probably the oldest sacred corporation
of Latium, as its liturgy, preserved in the Acta from the reign
of Augustus to that of Gordian, is the oldest specimen of the
Latin language.<a id="noteref_2774" name="noteref_2774" href="#note_2774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2774</span></span></a> According to the legend, the first members
were the twelve sons of Acca Larentia, the foster-mother of
Romulus, and Romulus himself first held the dignity of master
of the brotherhood.<a id="noteref_2775" name="noteref_2775" href="#note_2775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2775</span></span></a> Its patron goddess, Dea Dia,<a id="noteref_2776" name="noteref_2776" href="#note_2776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2776</span></span></a> was, as
her very name suggests, one of those dim shadowy conceptions
dear to old Roman awe, who was worshipped in the still
solitude of ancient groves, on whose trunks no axe of iron
might ever ring,<a id="noteref_2777" name="noteref_2777" href="#note_2777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2777</span></span></a> a power as elusive and multiform to picturing
fancy as the secret forces which shot up the corn ear from the
furrow. The whole tone of the antique ritual savours of a time
when the Latin race was a tribe of farmers, believing with a simple
faith that the yearly increase of their fields depended on the
favour of secret unearthly powers. The meetings of the college
took place on three days in May, the precise dates being fixed and
solemnly announced by their master on the 3rd of January.<a id="noteref_2778" name="noteref_2778" href="#note_2778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2778</span></span></a>
The festival began and ended in the master’s house at Rome, the
intermediate day being spent in a sacred grove on the right bank
of the Tiber, about four miles from the city. There was much
feasting, at which the brethren were attended by the Camilli,
four sons of high-born senators. Corn of the new and the
preceding year was touched and blessed; libations and incense
were offered to the goddess, and all the rites were performed
with many changes of costume, which were rigidly observed.<a id="noteref_2779" name="noteref_2779" href="#note_2779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2779</span></span></a>
In the ceremonies which took place in the grove, an expiatory
sacrifice of two porkers and a white cow was always offered,
to atone for the use of any iron implement, or other infringement
of the ancient rubric.<a id="noteref_2780" name="noteref_2780" href="#note_2780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2780</span></span></a> Fat lambs were offered in
sacrifice to Dea Dia, and ancient earthen vessels of rude make,

altar.<a id="noteref_2781" name="noteref_2781" href="#note_2781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2781</span></span></a> Ears of corn, plucked in some neighbouring field, were

and back again in reverse order, and, at last, in the closed
temple, along with solemn dancing, the famous chant was intoned
from ancient scrolls, the words of which had long become
strange even to the antiquary. After another meal in the hall
of the brotherhood, the members passed on to the circus and
gave the signal for the races to begin.<a id="noteref_2782" name="noteref_2782" href="#note_2782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2782</span></span></a>

This ritual, so little heard of before the time of Augustus,

The emperors were elected <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">magistri</span></span> of the College, and we

solemn vows are made in old Roman fashion for the emperor’s
safety, to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, to Salus and Dea Dia,

met to sacrifice in honour of Otho’s pontificate on the day
(March 14) on which he set out to meet his doom in the battle
on the Po. Thirteen days after his death, while the spring air
was still tainted with the rotting heaps on the plain of Bedriacum,
vows as fervent or as politic were registered for Vitellius.
In the summer of the following year, the arrival of Vespasian in

It was thus that the antique ritual of a rustic brotherhood
was converted into a potent support of the imperial power.
No part of the Augustan revival was perhaps so successful.
Probably few of the emperors, or of the aristocratic brothers
who intoned the litany for the safety of the imperial house,
had much faith in its efficacy. But the ceremony linked the
principate with the most venerable traditions of Latium, and
with Romulus the first master of the college. When we read
the minute and formal record of these coarse sacrifices and
rude, fantastic rites, with the chanting of prayers no longer
understood, we are amazed at the prolongation for so many
ages of religious ideas which the Roman mind might appear to
have outgrown. Yet in such inquiries there is often a danger
of treating society as a uniform mass, moving together along
the same lines, and permeated through all its strata by the
same influences. In another chapter we have shown that the
masses were probably never so superstitious as in the second
century. And the singular thing is that the influx of foreign
religions, due to the wide conquests of Rome, never to the end
seems to have shaken the supreme attachment of the people
to their ancient gods. It is true that the drift towards
monotheism was felt even among the crowd. But while the
educated might find expression for that tendency in the adoration
of Isis or the Sun, the dim monotheism of the people turned to
the glorification of Jupiter. Dedications to him are the most
numerous in all lands. He is often linked with other gods or all
the gods,<a id="noteref_2798" name="noteref_2798" href="#note_2798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2798</span></span></a> but he is always supreme. And, while he is the lord
of tempest and thunder,<a id="noteref_2799" name="noteref_2799" href="#note_2799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2799</span></span></a> he is also addressed by epithets which
show that he is becoming a moral and spiritual power. On

other gods are worshipped in the same spirit as of old. Roman
religion was essentially practical. Prayer and vow were the
means to win temporal blessings. The gods were expected, in
return for worship, to be of use to the devotee. It is evident
from the inscriptions that this conception of religion was as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page544">[pg 544]</span><a name="Pg544" id="Pg544" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prevalent in the age of the Antonines, or of the oriental princes,

A more difficult problem is presented by the attitude of the
cultivated class to the old mythologies. Since the days of
Xenophanes and of Plato, philosophy had revolted against the
degradation of the Divine character by ancient legend. It had
taught for ages the unity of the mysterious Power or Goodness
which lies behind the shifting scene of sense. Moreover,
philosophy for generations had deserted the heights of speculative
inquiry, and addressed itself to the task of applying the
spiritual truth which the schools had won to the problems of
practical religion and human life. Alike in Cicero, in Seneca,
in Plutarch, and M. Aurelius, there are conceptions of God and
the worship due to Him, of prayer, of the relation of conduct
to religion, which seem irreconcilable with conformity to the
old religion of Rome. How could a man, nourished on such
spiritual ideas and refined by a thousand years of growing
culture, take part in a gross materialistic worship, and even
gallantly defend it against all assailants?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The conformity of highly instructed minds to ancient
systems which their reason has outgrown is not always to be
explained by the easy imputation of dishonesty. And that
explanation is even less admissible in ancient than in modern
times. Roman religion did not demand any profession of faith
in any theory of the unseen; all it required was ceremonial
purity and exactness. And the Roman world was never
scandalised by the spectacle of a notorious sceptic or libertine
holding the office of chief pontiff. If a man were more
scrupulous himself, philosophy, whether of the Porch or the
Academy, came to his aid. It would tell him that frail
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page545">[pg 545]</span><a name="Pg545" id="Pg545" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>humanity, unable to comprehend the Infinite God, had parcelled
out and detached his various powers and virtues, which it
adored under material forms according to its varying needs.<a id="noteref_2806" name="noteref_2806" href="#note_2806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2806</span></span></a>
Or it found a place for all the gods of heathendom, as
ministering or mediating spirits in the vast abyss which
separates us from the unapproachable and Infinite Spirit.<a id="noteref_2807" name="noteref_2807" href="#note_2807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2807</span></span></a> If
the legends which had gathered around the popular gods
offended a tender moral sense, men were taught that the
apparent grossness was an allegorical husk, or a freak of poetic
fancy which concealed a wholesome truth. Thus a pantheist
or monotheist, who would never have created such a religious
system for himself, was trained to cultivate a double self in
matters of religion, to worship reverently with the crowd, and
to believe with Zeno or with Plato.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The heathen champion in the dialogue of Minucius Felix
maintains that, in the dimness and uncertainty of things,
the safest course is to hold fast to the gods of our fathers.<a id="noteref_2808" name="noteref_2808" href="#note_2808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2808</span></span></a>
The inclination of the sceptic was fortified by the conservative
instinct of the Latin race and its love of precedent and
precision of form. Moreover the religion of Numa was
probably more than any other involved and intertwined with
the whole life of the people. It penetrated the whole fabric
of society; it consecrated and dignified every public function,
and every act or incident of private life. To desert the
ancient gods was to cut oneself off from Roman society, as the
Christians were sternly made to feel. No established Church
in modern Christendom has probably ever so succeeded in
identifying itself with the national life in all its aspects.
Alike under the Republic and under the Empire, religion was
inseparable from patriotism. The imperial pontiff was bound
to watch over the purity and continuity of the Latin rites. He
might be a scoffer like Nero, or a spiritually-minded Stoic like
M. Aurelius, an Isiac devotee like Commodus, or devoted to the
Syrian worships like the Oriental princes of the third century.
But he took his duties seriously. He would dance with the Salii,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page546">[pg 546]</span><a name="Pg546" id="Pg546" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or accept with gratitude the mastership of the Arval brotherhood,
or order a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lectisternium</span></span> to ward off a pestilence or a menacing
invasion. The imperial colleges still held their meetings on
the eve of the revolution of Theodosius. Antiquarian nobles
still discussed nice questions of ritual in the reign of Honorius.
At the end of the fifth century the Lupercalia were still
celebrated with coarse, half-savage rites which went back to the
prehistoric times.<a id="noteref_2809" name="noteref_2809" href="#note_2809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2809</span></span></a> The imperial policy, founded by Augustus,
no doubt inspired much of this conformity. But old Roman
sentiment, the passion expressed with such moving eloquence
by Symmachus, to feel himself in touch with a distant past<a id="noteref_2810" name="noteref_2810" href="#note_2810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2810</span></span></a>
through a chain of unbroken continuity, was the great support
of the State religion in the fourth century as in the first. Yet,
among the great nobles who were its last champions—Flavianus,
Praetextatus, or Volusianus—there was a spiritual craving for
which the religion provided little satisfaction. They sought it
in the rites and mysteries of Eastern lands which had little in
common with the old Roman religious sentiment. In these
alien rites they found a new religious atmosphere. The priest,
set apart from the world, with his life-long obligations and the
daily offices in the shrine, becomes in some way a minister
to the spiritual life of his flock. Instead of cold ceremonial
observance, ecstatic emotion is aroused, often to a degree which
was perilous to character. Through a series of sacraments, with
ascetic preparation for them, the votary rose under priestly
guidance to some vision of the eternal world, with a new
conception of sin; this life and the next were linked in a moral
sequence, with tremendous issues of endless beatitude or endless
degradation. In a temple of Magna Mater, Isis, or Mithra in
the reign of Julian, we are far away from the worship of the
Lares and the offering of a heifer to Dea Dia in the grove on
the Tiber. We are travelling towards the spiritual mystery
and sacramental consolations of the mediaeval Church.

The earliest invader from the East of the sober decorum of
old Roman religion, and almost the last to succumb, was
Magna Mater of Pessinus. There is no pagan cult which S.
Augustine, and many of the Fathers before him, assail with
such indignant contempt as hers.<a id="noteref_2811" name="noteref_2811" href="#note_2811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2811</span></span></a> And indeed it was long
regarded with suspicion by old Romans of the cultivated class.
For generations after her reception on the Palatine, no Roman
was permitted to enter her official service. But there was
something in that noisy and bloody ritual, and in the cruel,
ascetic sacrifice of its devotees, which exercised an irresistible
power over the imagination of the vulgar; and even Lucretius
felt a certain imaginative awe of the tower-crowned figure
drawn by lions and adored by the cities of many lands.<a id="noteref_2812" name="noteref_2812" href="#note_2812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2812</span></span></a>

Her baptism of blood in the taurobolium was a rite of such
strange enthralling influence that it needed all the force of the
Christian Empire to abolish it. And on many of the last
inscriptions of the fourth century the greatest names in the
Roman aristocracy leave the record of their cleansing in the
curious phrase <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">renatus in aeternum</span></span>.<a id="noteref_2814" name="noteref_2814" href="#note_2814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2814</span></span></a> In his youth S. Augustine
had seen processions of effeminate figures with dripping locks,
painted faces, and soft womanish bearing, passing along the
streets of Carthage, and begging alms of the crowd. His
horror at the memory of the scene probably springs almost
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page548">[pg 548]</span><a name="Pg548" id="Pg548" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as much from the manly instincts of the Roman as from

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But S. Augustine knew well the power of the superstition.
For more than 600 years the Great Mother had been enthroned

within the scope of our present inquiry to trace the immense
popularity of the worship under the princes of the third
century. That was the period of the great triumph of the
spiritual powers of the East. At the end of the fourth century
the Great Mother and Mithra were in the van of the pagan
resistance to the religious revolution of Theodosius and his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of Cybele, coming from the same regions as the
Trojan ancestors of Rome, was at first a patrician cult.<a id="noteref_2834" name="noteref_2834" href="#note_2834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2834</span></span></a>

Romans were for generations forbidden to enrol themselves
among her effeminate priesthood. By a curious contradiction
of sentiment, people were fascinated by the ritual, while they
despised the celebrants. The legend which was interpreted by
Stoic and Neoplatonist as full of physical or metaphysical
meanings,<a id="noteref_2836" name="noteref_2836" href="#note_2836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2836</span></span></a> had also elements of human interest which appealed
to the masses, always eager for emotional excitement. The love
of the Great Mother for a fair youth, his unfaithfulness, and
penitential self-mutilation under the pine-tree; the passionate
mourning for lost love, and then the restoration of the self-made
victim, attended by a choir of priests for ever, who had made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page550">[pg 550]</span><a name="Pg550" id="Pg550" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the same cruel sacrifice<a id="noteref_2837" name="noteref_2837" href="#note_2837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2837</span></span></a>—all this, so alien to old Roman
religious sentiment, triumphed over it in the end by novelty
and tragic interest. The legend was developed into a drama,
which, at the vernal festival of the goddess, was produced
with striking, if not artistic, effect. On the first day the
Dendrophori bore the sacred tree, wreathed with violets, to
the temple. There was then a pause for a day, and, on the
third, the priests, with frantic gestures and dishevelled hair,
abandoned themselves to the wildest mourning, lacerating their
arms and shoulders with wounds, from which the blood flowed
in torrents. Severe fasting accompanied these self-inflicted
tortures. Then came a complete change of sensation. On the
day called Hilaria the votaries gave themselves up to ecstasies
of joy, to celebrate the restoration of Attis. On the last day
of the festival a solemn procession took its way to the brook
Almon, to bathe the goddess in its waters.<a id="noteref_2838" name="noteref_2838" href="#note_2838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2838</span></span></a> The sacred stone,
brought originally from her home in Asia, and the most sacred
symbol of the worship, wrapped in robes, was borne upon a
car with chants and music, and that gross, unabashed
naturalism which so often shocks and surprises us in pagan
ritual till we trace it to its source.

numbers into the sacred service in the times of the Empire.

But the pages of Apuleius, and other authorities, show us
that, beside the official clergy and collegiate members, there
were, as happens to all popular religions, a mass of unlicensed
camp followers and mere disreputable vagrants, who used the
name of the Great Mother to exploit the ignorant devotion
and religious excitability of the rustic folk. The romance of
Apuleius, as Dr. Mahaffy has suggested, is probably derived
from earlier sources, and dressed up to titillate the prurient
tastes of a degraded society.<a id="noteref_2849" name="noteref_2849" href="#note_2849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2849</span></span></a> Yet its pictures of country life
in Thessaly, although they may not be always locally accurate,
can hardly be purely imaginative. The scenes may not be
always Thessalian, but that they are in the main true pictures
of country life in the Antonine age may be proved from other
authorities. Apuleius was too careful an artist to sever himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page552">[pg 552]</span><a name="Pg552" id="Pg552" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>altogether from the actual life of his time. And what a picture
it is! The air positively thrills with daemonic terror and
power. Witches and lewd sorceresses abound; the solitary
inn has its weird seductions; the lonely country cottage has
its tragedy of lawless love or of chaste devotion to the dead.
Brigands in mountain fastnesses divide their far-gathered spoil,
and hold debate on plans of future lawless adventure. Mountain
solitudes, and lonely villages or castles among the woods, are
aroused by the yelping hounds, who start the boar from his
lair, while the faithless traitor places his friend at its mercy.
We meet the travelling cheese merchant, and the noble exile
on his way to Zacynthus. We watch the raid on the banker’s
house at Thebes, and the peasants setting their dogs on the
passing traveller; the insolence of the wandering legionary;
the horrors of the slave prison, with its wasted, starved, and
branded forms; the amours of buxom wives, and the comic concealment
or discovery of lovers, in the manner of Boccaccio.
It is only too certain that the vileness and superstition which
Apuleius has depicted may easily find a parallel on the Roman
stage, or in the pages of Martial.

In all this social panorama, romantic, amusing, or disgusting,
there is no more repulsive, and probably no truer scene
than that in which the wandering priests of the Syrian goddess
appear. That deity, like many others of Eastern origin, was
often identified with the Great Mother. Apuleius probably
confounded them; the rites of their worships were often the
same, and the picture in Apuleius may be taken to represent
the orgies of many a wandering troop of professed devotees of
the Great Mother in the age of the Antonines.<a id="noteref_2850" name="noteref_2850" href="#note_2850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2850</span></span></a> The leader

foulest morals, carrying about with him an image of the goddess,
and levying alms from the superstition of the rustics. He is
attended by a crew worthy of him, wretches defiled with all
the worst vices of the ancient world, and shamelessly parading
their degradation. But they combine a shrewd eye to business
with this wild licence. They know all the arts to catch the
fancy of the mob of clowns, whose grey dull lives and inbred
superstition make them eager for any display which will
intoxicate them with the novelty of a violent sensation. These
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page553">[pg 553]</span><a name="Pg553" id="Pg553" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>people are on that level where lust and the passion for blood
and suffering readily league themselves with religious excitement.
After a night of moral horrors, the foul brotherhood go
forth in various costume to win the largesses of the countryside.
With painted cheeks and robes of white or yellow,
crossed with purple stripes, their arms bared to the shoulder,

the penalty from his own hands.<a id="noteref_2852" name="noteref_2852" href="#note_2852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2852</span></span></a> With hard knotted scourge

the impostors, and as eagerly gathered in.<a id="noteref_2853" name="noteref_2853" href="#note_2853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2853</span></span></a> Surprised in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The episode in Apuleius suggests some curious questions as
to the moral effect of these emotional cults. That in their
early stages they had no elevating moral influence,—nay, that
their votaries might combine a strict conformity to rite with
great looseness of life,—is only too certain. The Delias and
Cynthias of the poets, who kept the fasts of Isis, were assuredly
not models of virtue. The assumption of the tonsure and
linen habit by a debauchee like Commodus does not reassure
us. Yet princes of high character in the second and the
third centuries lent the countenance of imperial power to the
worships of the East.<a id="noteref_2855" name="noteref_2855" href="#note_2855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2855</span></span></a> And the Mother of the Gods found
her last and most gallant defenders among great nobles of
high repute and sincere pagan piety in the last years of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page554">[pg 554]</span><a name="Pg554" id="Pg554" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heathenism in the West. It was a strange transformation.
Yet the problem is not perhaps insoluble. A religion may
deteriorate as its authority over society becomes more assured
with age. But, in times of moral renovation, and in the face
of powerful spiritual rivalries, a religion may purge itself of
the impurities of youth. Religious systems may also be
elevated by the growing moral refinement of the society to
which they minister. It is only thus that we can explain the
undoubted fact that the Phrygian and Egyptian worships,
originally tainted with the grossness of naturalism, became
vehicles of a warm religious emotion, and provided a stimulus
to a higher life. The idealism of humanity, by a strange
alchemy, can marvellously transform the most unpromising
materials. And he would make a grave mistake who should
treat the Isis and Osiris, the Mater Deum or the Attis, of
the reign of Augustus as representing the same ideals in the
reign of Gratian. But these Eastern cults contained a germ,
even in their earliest days, of their great future development
and power. The old religion of Latium, along with much
that was sound and grave and fortifying to character, was also
hard and cold and ceremonial. It could mould and consecrate
a militant and conquering state; it did little to satisfy the
craving for moral regeneration or communion with a Higher
Power. It could not appease the sense of error and frailty
by ghostly comfort and sacramental absolution. It was, moreover,
wanting in that warmth of interest and sympathy, linking
the human and Divine, which has helped to make Christianity
the religion of Western civilisation, and which in a feeble adumbration
made the paganism of the East a momentary rival of
the Church. These Eastern cults, often originating in gross
symbolism of the alternations and recurring processes of
nature,<a id="noteref_2856" name="noteref_2856" href="#note_2856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2856</span></span></a> often arousing a dangerous excitability and an unregulated
emotion, yet contained the germ of a religious spirit
far more akin to ours than the old austere Latin creed. A
divine death and restoration, the alternation of joy and sorrow
at a divine event, instinct with human interest, calming
expiation and cleansing from the sins which burdened the
conscience,—above all, the hope of a coming life, stamped on
the imagination by symbol and spectacle,—these were the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page555">[pg 555]</span><a name="Pg555" id="Pg555" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>elements which, operating on imperious religious yearnings,
gave a fresh life to paganism, and prepared or deferred the
victory of the Church. The religion of the Great Mother
seems at first sight to offer the poorest promise of any moral
message or spiritual support. It expressed at first the feelings
of rude rustics at the recurring mortality and resurrection of
material life in the order of the seasons. The element of human
feeling which it contained was grossly expressed in bloody
rites of mutilation. This cult was often defiled and disgraced
by a crew of effeminate and lustful impostors. Yet the Thessalian
villagers in Apuleius, who chased these vagabonds from
their fields, evidently expected something better from them.
They despised the foul hypocrites, but they did not cease to
believe in their religion. The spiritual instinct of humanity
triumphed, as it has so often done, over the vices of a historical
system, extracted the good in it, rejected the evil, and
made it an organ of some sort of spiritual life. Thus the Great
Mother became the Mother of all, enthroned beside the Father
of gods and men. She wears the chaste honours of the Virgin
Goddess. Attis and her love for Attis are similarly transformed.
In the syncretism of the age, which strove to gather
up all the forces of heathenism and make them converge
towards a spiritual unity, Magna Mater and Attis leagued
their forces with the conquering Mithra.<a id="noteref_2857" name="noteref_2857" href="#note_2857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2857</span></span></a> In the taurobolium
there was developed a ritual, in which, coarse and materialistic
as it was, paganism made, in however imperfect form, its
nearest approach to the religion of the Cross.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The greatest and most impressive rite in the worship of
Cybele was the taurobolium. There was none which so
excited the suspicion and indignation of the Christian apologists,
from Tertullian to Prudentius, because in its ceremony of the
cleansing blood, and in its supposed effects in moral regeneration
and remission of sins, it seemed invented by the ingenuity
of daemons to be a travesty of the sacrifice on Calvary.<a id="noteref_2858" name="noteref_2858" href="#note_2858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2858</span></span></a> It is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page556">[pg 556]</span><a name="Pg556" id="Pg556" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>possible that the last champions of the ancient cults may
have had some such defiant purpose when they inscribed, in
the record of their cleansing, the words <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in aeternum renatus</span></span>.”</span>
But in its origin there can be no doubt that the rite was
purely heathen. Its appearance in the Phrygian ceremonial
is comparatively late. The worship of Magna Mater was
essentially an orgiastic cult, and theologically arid. But the
syncretism of the second and third centuries came to its
support. And the worships of Persia, Syria, and Phrygia were
ready to coalesce, and to borrow from one another symbols and
doctrines which gave satisfaction to the spiritual wants of
the time. The taurobolium, with its ideas of cleansing and
immortality, passed in the Antonine age from the worship of
Anaitis of Cappadocia to the worship of Magna Mater, and
gave the Great Mother a new hold upon the religious consciousness.
In the earlier votive tablets the name of the rite is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tauropolium</span></span>. Anaitis had been identified with the Artemis
Tauropolus of Brauron, whose legend, by popular etymology,
came to be identified, as Milesian exploration spread in the
Euxine, with the cult of the cruel goddess of the Tauric
Chersonese.<a id="noteref_2859" name="noteref_2859" href="#note_2859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2859</span></span></a> And by another etymological freak and the
change of a letter, we arrive at the bull-slaughtering rite of
the later Empire. Whether the taurobolium ever became
part of the service of Mithra is a disputed point.<a id="noteref_2860" name="noteref_2860" href="#note_2860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2860</span></span></a> Certainly
the syncretistic tendency of the age, the fact that the most
popular Mithraist symbol was the slaying of the mystic bull,
and the record of the taurobolium on so many inscriptions
dedicated to Mithra, would prepare us for the conclusion that
the rite was in the end common to the Persian and the
Phrygian deities. Whatever may be the truth on this point,
the two worships, in the last ages of heathenism in the West,
were close allies. Attis tended more and more to become a
solar deity in the age which culminated in the sun-worship
of Julian.<a id="noteref_2861" name="noteref_2861" href="#note_2861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2861</span></span></a> Heliolatry, the last refuge of monotheism in
heathendom, which refused to accept the religion of Galilee,
swept all the great worships of strong vitality into its system,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page557">[pg 557]</span><a name="Pg557" id="Pg557" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>softened their differences, accentuated their similarities, by
every effort of fancy, false science, or reckless etymology, and
in the end, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sol invictus”</span> and Mithra were left masters of
the field. But Magna Mater, however originally unworthy,
shared in the victory. If she could lend the support of an
accredited clergy, recognised for ages by the State, and the
impressive rite of the bloody baptism, Mithra, on the other
hand, had a moral and spiritual message, an assurance of a
future life, and an enthralling force of mystic and sacramental
communion, which made his alliance even more valuable. The
Great Mother, indeed, admitted women to the ranks of her clergy,
while the rites of Mithra probably excluded them.<a id="noteref_2862" name="noteref_2862" href="#note_2862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2862</span></span></a> And thus
a Fabia Aconia Paulina, while her husband, Vettius Agorius
Praetextatus, could inscribe himself <span class="tei tei-q">“pater patrum,”</span> had no
Mithraist grade which she could place beside her consecration
to Hecate and the Eleusinian goddesses.<a id="noteref_2863" name="noteref_2863" href="#note_2863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2863</span></span></a> But the pair were
united in the sacrament of the taurobolium. And the Great
Mother probably never had purer or sincerer devotees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the taurobolium was first introduced into the West
is uncertain.<a id="noteref_2864" name="noteref_2864" href="#note_2864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2864</span></span></a> The earliest monument belongs to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 134 in
the reign of Hadrian, when the ceremony seems to be connected
with the Celestial Venus. The most famous inscription, which
connects the rite with the Great Mother, is of the year 160
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, when one L. Aemilius Carpus, an Augustalis, and a member
of the college of the Dendrophori at Lyons, had the ceremony
performed <span class="tei tei-q">“for the safety”</span> of Antoninus Pius and the imperial
house.<a id="noteref_2865" name="noteref_2865" href="#note_2865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2865</span></span></a> The rite was celebrated at the command of the goddess,
or on the inspired advice of the priest.<a id="noteref_2866" name="noteref_2866" href="#note_2866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2866</span></span></a> It took place generally
in early spring, and was often prolonged over three or four days.<a id="noteref_2867" name="noteref_2867" href="#note_2867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2867</span></span></a>
It was a costly rite, and the expense was sometimes borne by
the community, who made an offertory for the purpose.<a id="noteref_2868" name="noteref_2868" href="#note_2868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2868</span></span></a> The
ceremony was superintended by the xvviri, and attended by a
great concourse of the people, with the magistrates at their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page558">[pg 558]</span><a name="Pg558" id="Pg558" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>head. It is needless to describe again the scene, so well known
from the verses of Prudentius, in which the consecrated bull
is with solemn forms slaughtered on a high-raised platform, and
bathes with the streams of his blood the votary placed in a
trench below.<a id="noteref_2869" name="noteref_2869" href="#note_2869"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2869</span></span></a> The rite was believed to impart some sort of
strength and purification, the effect of which lasted for twenty
years, when the sacrament was often renewed. It was, as we
have seen, sometimes performed <span class="tei tei-q">“with intention,”</span> for the reigning
emperor and his house,<a id="noteref_2870" name="noteref_2870" href="#note_2870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2870</span></span></a> and furnishes another example of
the manner in which religion was employed to buttress the
power of the Caesars. A considerable number of monuments
in Italy and the provinces commemorate, in a phrase perhaps
borrowed from the Church, the gratitude of one <span class="tei tei-q">“born again
to eternal life.”</span> It is probable that the coarse ritual often
expressed only an external and materialistic conception of
religious influence. On the other hand, following upon, or
closely connected with initiation into the mysteries of Mithra,
it may easily have become a symbol of moral and spiritual
truth, or at any rate a record of moral aspiration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, indeed, in the syncretism and monotheistic drift of the
age, the more powerful worships lost the hardness of their
original lines and tended to absorption and assimilation.
There was little strife or repulsion among these cults; they
borrowed freely legends and ritual practice from one another;
even characteristic insignia were interchanged. The legend
and tone of the Cybele worship naturally linked her with
others sprung from the same region, such as the Syrian goddess,
Celestial Venus, and Bellona.<a id="noteref_2871" name="noteref_2871" href="#note_2871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2871</span></span></a> Fanaticism, self-mutilation,
expiation by blood, were the common bond between them.
The fierce goddess of Cappadocia, who had visited Sulla in a
dream, was probably first introduced to Roman devotion in his
time. Her dark-robed priests and priestesses were familiar
figures in the Augustan age, gashing themselves like the Galli of
Magna Mater, catching the blood in shields, and dashing it
over their train of followers who believed in its powers of
expiation. But Magna Mater, as her name promises, assumed
a milder character, and was identified sometimes with Maia,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page559">[pg 559]</span><a name="Pg559" id="Pg559" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Ops, and Minerva; sometimes with Demeter, Bona Dea, and
Fauna, as Attis was identified with Hercules.<a id="noteref_2872" name="noteref_2872" href="#note_2872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2872</span></span></a> In the last age
the great goddess became the universal Mother, full of tenderness
and grace, and giving peace through her cleansing rites.
Hers is, along with the cults of Isis and Mithra, which will
next claim our attention, an example of the process of Divine
evolution, by which, in the painful progress of humanity, the
crude efforts of religious symbolism are purged and elevated.
It is an example of the way in which the human spirit, refusing
to break with its past, sometimes succeeds, if only for a
time, in putting new wine into old bottles.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of Isis and Serapis, reckoning from the day when
it established itself in the port of Athens, had a reign of more
than seven centuries over the peoples of Europe. Its influence
in the western provinces of the Empire and in the capital may
be roughly said to cover a period of 500 years. It was not,
indeed, the old native worship of the valley of the Nile which
won such an empire over cultivated intellects from Chaeronea
to the Thames. The ancient Egyptian worship underwent vast
transformations in the crucible of all creeds at Alexandria.
It was captured and utilised for political purposes by the
Ptolemies.<a id="noteref_2873" name="noteref_2873" href="#note_2873"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2873</span></span></a> It was linked with the most spiritual forces of

the subtle syncretism of later Greek philosophy; and, through
the secretaries of embassies, and the Egyptian slaves and
merchants who poured into the ports of southern Italy in the
second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, it stole or forced itself into the chapels of
great houses at Rome, till, in the end, emperors were proud to
receive its tonsure, to walk in the processions, and to build
and adorn Egyptian temples.<a id="noteref_2875" name="noteref_2875" href="#note_2875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2875</span></span></a>

The Isiac worship had conquered the Greek world before it
became a power in Italy. In the fourth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> traders
from the Nile had their temple of Isis at the Peiraeus;<a id="noteref_2876" name="noteref_2876" href="#note_2876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2876</span></span></a> in the

Orchomenus and Chaeronea for generations before Plutarch
found in her legends a congenial field for the exposition of
his concordat between philosophy and myth. Nor need we
wonder at his choice of the Egyptian cults. For the Isis and
Osiris of Greek and Italian lands were very different objects
of devotion from the gods who bore those names in Egyptian
legend.<a id="noteref_2879" name="noteref_2879" href="#note_2879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2879</span></span></a> From the seventh century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> Greeks from the

steeped in Orphic and Pythagorean mysticism, returned from
the valley of the Nile to spread the doctrine of a common
faith. After the foundation of Alexandria the theory became
a propaganda. The first Ptolemy strove to unite the two
races under his sway by an eclecticism of which Alexandria
was the focus for seven centuries. He found skilful allies
in Manetho, the Egyptian priest who had written a treatise
on the inner meaning of the myths, and in Timotheus, a
scion of the Eumolpidae of Eleusis.<a id="noteref_2883" name="noteref_2883" href="#note_2883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2883</span></span></a> The Orphic and Dionysiac
mysticism was leagued with the Isiac worship. The legend
of Egypt was recast. A new deity was introduced, who
was destined to have a great future in all lands under the
Roman sway. The origin of Serapis is still a mystery<a id="noteref_2884" name="noteref_2884" href="#note_2884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2884</span></span></a> and
the latest critic may have to acquiesce in the confused or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page562">[pg 562]</span><a name="Pg562" id="Pg562" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>balanced judgment of Tacitus.<a id="noteref_2885" name="noteref_2885" href="#note_2885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2885</span></span></a> Egyptian archaeologists
claimed him as indigenous at Rhacotis or Memphis, and
construed his name as a compound of Osiris and that of his
earthly incarnation, the bull Apis.<a id="noteref_2886" name="noteref_2886" href="#note_2886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2886</span></span></a> The more popular tale
was that the first Ptolemy, after repeated visions of the night,
sent envoys to bring him from Sinope, where he was identified
with Pluto, god of the under world. Other traditions connected
him with Seleucia in Cappadocia, or with Babylon.<a id="noteref_2887" name="noteref_2887" href="#note_2887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2887</span></span></a>
It may be that a false etymology, confounding a hill near
Memphis with the name of Sinope, was the source of the tale
in Tacitus.<a id="noteref_2888" name="noteref_2888" href="#note_2888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2888</span></span></a> However this may be, Serapis takes the place of
Osiris; they never appear together in inscriptions. The infant
Horus received the Greek sounding name Harpocrates, and
Serapis, Isis, and Harpocrates became the Egyptian Trinity for
Graeco-Roman Society. Anubis, the minister of the Trinity,
was easily identified with Hermes, <span class="tei tei-q">“the conductor of souls”</span> in
Greek legend.

Syncretism and mysticism were great forces at Eleusis, from
which Ptolemy’s adviser Timotheus came. And there all
interest centred in the future life, and in preparation for it
by sacerdotal ritual and moral discipline. The Orphic and
Pythagorean mysticism which traced itself to Egypt or the
remoter East, returned to its sources, to aid in moulding the
cults of Egypt into a worship for the world. A crowd of
ingenious theologians set to work, by means of physical explanation,
wild etymology, and fanciful analogies, to complete
the syncretism. And the final results of their efforts, preserved
in the famous treatise of Plutarch on Isis, is a trinitarian
monotheism, with an original dualism of the good and evil
principles.<a id="noteref_2889" name="noteref_2889" href="#note_2889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2889</span></span></a> But the idea of God, although limited in one
sense by the recognition of a co-ordinate evil power, tends on
the other to become more all-embracing. Serapis is constantly
linked with Jupiter and Sol Invictus in the inscriptions.<a id="noteref_2890" name="noteref_2890" href="#note_2890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2890</span></span></a> In

The Isiac worship arrived in Italy probably through the
ports of Campania. Puteoli, in particular, was the great
entrepôt for the trade with Alexandria. Foreign merchants,
sailors, and slaves were arriving there every day, and, in the century
between 204 and 100 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, more than ten embassies passed
between the Ptolemies and the Roman Senate, with a crowd of
secretaries and servants attached to them.<a id="noteref_2894" name="noteref_2894" href="#note_2894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2894</span></span></a> There was probably
a temple of Serapis at Puteoli as early as 150 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, and the
old temple of Isis at Pompeii, which was thrown down by the
earthquake of 63 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, may probably be referred to the year
105 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span><a id="noteref_2895" name="noteref_2895" href="#note_2895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2895</span></span></a> But the erection of temples must have been preceded
by a period of less formal and more obscure worship, and we
may perhaps conclude that Isis had established herself in
Southern Italy, at all events early in the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>
Thus, although it was generations before the worship won its
way, in the face of fierce persecution, to an assured place at
Rome, its first appearance coincides with the decay of the
old religion, the religious excitement in the beginning of the
second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, and the immense popular craving for a
more emotional form of worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The years at the end of the third and the beginning of
the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> were in Italy years of strange religious
excitement. In 204 the great goddess was brought from
Pessinus.<a id="noteref_2896" name="noteref_2896" href="#note_2896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2896</span></span></a> In 186 the decree for the suppression of the

were the first points assailed by the invasion of the orgiastic
rites. But they soon crept into the capital, with results which
alarmed and shocked old Roman sentiment. At first, an
appearance of asceticism disguised the danger. But the
rites soon gave an opportunity for the wildest licence and for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page564">[pg 564]</span><a name="Pg564" id="Pg564" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>political intrigue. 7000 men and women were found to be
implicated, in one way or another, in the movement.<a id="noteref_2898" name="noteref_2898" href="#note_2898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2898</span></span></a> Within
five years after the great scandal, the apocryphal books of
Numa were unearthed in the grounds of Cn. Terentius on the
Janiculum. The forgery was soon detected, and they were
burnt publicly in the Comitium by the praetor L. Petilius.<a id="noteref_2899" name="noteref_2899" href="#note_2899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2899</span></span></a>
But it was a suspicious circumstance that the rolls were of
Egyptian papyrus, which had been till then unknown to the
Roman world, and that they contained the dogmas of a
Pythagorean lore which was equally strange. It is almost
certain that, in the same years in which the Dionysiac fanaticism
arrived at Ostia, the Egyptian cults had been brought by
merchants and sailors to Puteoli. Osiris and Dionysus had
long been identified by the Alexandrian theologians; both were
the patrons of mystic rites which, in their form and essence,
had much in common, and the Pythagorean system, combining
so many influences of philosophy and religion in the East and
West, was the natural sponsor of the new worships. It
was perhaps some eclectic Alexandrian, half Platonist, half
Buddhist, devoted to the Isiac worship, yet ready to connect it
with the Dionysiac legends of Delphi, Cithaeron, and Eleusis,
who penned the secret scrolls, and buried them in the garden
on the Janiculum. The movement was setting in which, so
often repulsed by the force of government and conservative
feeling, was destined to have enormous influence over the last
three centuries of paganism in the West.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been plausibly suggested that the ease and completeness
with which the Bacchanalian movement was suppressed
in 186 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> was due to the diversion of religious interest to the
Egyptian mysteries. The cult of Isis had indeed very various
attractions for different minds. But for the masses, slaves,
freedmen, and poor working people, its great fascination lay in
the pomp of its ritual, and the passionate emotion aroused by
the mourning for the dead Osiris, and his joyful restoration.
It is this aspect of the worship which is assailed and ridiculed
by the Christian apologists of the reign of Alexander Severus
and of the reign of Constantine.<a id="noteref_2900" name="noteref_2900" href="#note_2900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2900</span></span></a> The goddess, one of whose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page565">[pg 565]</span><a name="Pg565" id="Pg565" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>special functions was the care of mothers in childbirth, appealed
especially to female sensibility. As in the cult of Magna
Mater, women had a prominent place in her services and processions,
and records of these sacred dignities appear on the
monuments of great Roman ladies down to the end of the
Western Empire. The history of the Isiac cult at Rome from
Sulla to Nero is really the history of a great popular religious
movement in conflict with a reactionary conservatism, of
cosmopolitan feeling arrayed against old Roman sentiment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is significant of the popularity of Isis that the reactionary
Sulla, who restored the election of chief pontiff to the sacred
college, was forced to recognise the Isiac guild of the Pastophori
in 80 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span><a id="noteref_2901" name="noteref_2901" href="#note_2901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2901</span></span></a> Four times in the decade 58-48 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, the

The influence of Cleopatra over Julius Caesar overcame his
own prejudices and probably hastened the triumph of the
popular cult. The triumvirs had to conciliate public feeling
by erecting a temple of Isis in 42 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span><a id="noteref_2905" name="noteref_2905" href="#note_2905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2905</span></span></a> Priestesses

stoled priests were to be seen everywhere. In the reign
of Tiberius a serious blow fell on the Eastern worships.
According to Josephus, a great lady named Paulina, was, with
the collusion of the priest, seduced in an Isiac temple by a
libertine lover in the guise of Anubis, and the crime was
sternly punished by the emperor.<a id="noteref_2909" name="noteref_2909" href="#note_2909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2909</span></span></a> Tacitus and Suetonius
seem to be ignorant of this particular scandal, but they record
the wholesale banishment to Sardinia of persons of the freedmen
class, who were infected with Judaic or Egyptian
superstition. In the grotto of Cagliari there is to be seen the
record of an obscure romance and tragedy which may have
been connected with this persecution. Atilia Pomptilla, who
bore also the significant name of Benedicta, in some great
calamity had followed her husband Cassius Philippus into
exile. Their union had lasted for two-and-forty years
when the husband was stricken with disease in that deadly
climate. Like another Alcestis, Atilia by her vows and
devotion offered her life for his. The husband repaid the
debt in these inscriptions, and the pair lie united in death
under the sculptured serpent of the goddess whom they
probably worshipped.<a id="noteref_2910" name="noteref_2910" href="#note_2910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2910</span></span></a>

Thenceforth under the emperors Isis met with but little
opposition. Claudius struck hard at the Jewish and Druidic
rites, but on the other hand he was ready to transport those
of Eleusis to Rome.<a id="noteref_2911" name="noteref_2911" href="#note_2911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2911</span></span></a> He was probably equally tolerant to

trade and far-spreading influence of what was then the
second city in the Empire might have given a wide diffusion
even to a religion less adapted to satisfy the spiritual wants of
the time. Slaves and freedmen were always the most ardent
adherents and apostles of foreign rites. Names of persons of
this class appear on many monuments as holders of Isiac
office or liberal benefactors. A little brotherhood of household
slaves at Valentia in Spain were united in the worship.<a id="noteref_2921" name="noteref_2921" href="#note_2921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2921</span></span></a>

philosophers, and savants to the West. Several men of
Egyptian origin filled high places in the imperial household,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page568">[pg 568]</span><a name="Pg568" id="Pg568" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as librarians or secretaries in the first and second centuries.

and imperial secretary in the reign of Trajan. And Julius
Vestinus, who held these offices under Hadrian, is described
in an inscription as chief pontiff of Egypt and Alexandria,—a
combination of dignities which probably enabled him to
throw his powerful protection around the Isiac rites at
Rome.<a id="noteref_2925" name="noteref_2925" href="#note_2925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2925</span></span></a> An influence so securely seated on the Palatine was
sure to extend to the remotest parts of the Empire. If Isis

might she not do when emperors were enrolled in her priesthood,

prefecture from Britain to the Euphrates, were steeped in her
mystic lore?

Although Isis and Serapis were not peculiarly soldiers’ gods,

barbaric music, with the sacred images and symbols of a worship

of Romulus, and transmuted by the eclectic subtlety of Platonic
theologians into a cosmopolitan religion, were reproduced in
remote villages on the edge of the Sahara and the Atlantic,
in the valleys of the Alps or the Yorkshire dales.

What was the secret of this power and fascination in the
religion of a race whose cult of the dog and cat had so often
moved the ridicule of the satirist and comic poet? No single
answer can be given to that question. The great power of
Isis <span class="tei tei-q">“of myriad names”</span> was that, transfigured by Greek
influences, she appealed to many orders of intellect, and
satisfied many religious needs or fancies. To the philosopher
her legends furnished abundant material for the conciliation of
religion and pseudo-science, for the translation of myth into
ancient cosmic theory, or for the absorption of troublesome
mythologies into a system which perhaps tended more than
any other, except that of Mithra, to the Platonic idea of the
unity of God. The mystic who dreamt of an ecstasy of divine
communion, in which the limits of sense and personality might
be left behind in a vague rapture of imaginative emotion,
found in the spectacle of her inner shrine a strange power far
surpassing the most transporting effects of Eleusis. Women
especially saw in the divine mother and mourner a glorified
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page570">[pg 570]</span><a name="Pg570" id="Pg570" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>type of their sex, in all its troubles and its tenderness, such as
their daughters in coming ages were destined to find in the
Virgin Mother.<a id="noteref_2936" name="noteref_2936" href="#note_2936"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2936</span></span></a> The ascetic impulse, which has seldom been
far from the deepest religious feeling, derived comfort and
the sense of atonement in penitential abstinence and preparation
for the holy mysteries. The common mass, who are affected
chiefly by the externals of a religion, had their wants amply
gratified in the pomp and solemnity of morning sacrifice and
vespers, in those many-coloured processions, such as that which
bore in spring-time the sacred vessel to the shore, with the sound
of hymn and litany.<a id="noteref_2937" name="noteref_2937" href="#note_2937"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2937</span></span></a> And in an age when men were everywhere
banding themselves together in clubs and colleges for
mutual help and comfort, the sacred guilds of Isis had
evidently an immense influence. That evil, as in nearly all
heathen worships, often lurked under her solemn forms cannot
be denied, though there was also groundless calumny.<a id="noteref_2938" name="noteref_2938" href="#note_2938"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2938</span></span></a> Yet
there must have been some strange power in a religion which
could for a moment lift a sensualist imagination like that of
Apuleius almost to the height and purity of Eckhart and
Tauler.<a id="noteref_2939" name="noteref_2939" href="#note_2939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2939</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The triumph of Isis and Serapis in the Western world is
an instructive episode in the history of religion. It is, like
that of Mithra, a curious example of the union of conservative
feeling with a purifying and transforming influence
of the growing moral sense. A religion has a double strength
and fascination which has a venerable past behind it. The
ancient symbolism may be the creation of an age of gross
conceptions of the Divine, it may be even grotesque and
repulsive, at first sight, to the more refined spiritual sense of
an advanced moral culture. Yet the religious instinct will
always strive to maintain its continuity with the past, however
it may transfigure the legacy of ruder ages. Just as Christian
theologians long found anticipations of the Gospel among
patriarchs and warrior kings of Israel, so pagan theologians
like Plutarch or Aristides could discover in the cults of Egypt
all their highest cosmic theories, and satisfaction for all their
spiritual wants.<a id="noteref_2940" name="noteref_2940" href="#note_2940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2940</span></span></a> With unwavering faith, Plutarch and his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page571">[pg 571]</span><a name="Pg571" id="Pg571" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kind believed that under all the coarse mythic fancy of early
ages there was veiled a profound insight into the secrets of
nature and the spiritual needs of humanity. The land of
the Nile, with its charm of immemorial antiquity, was long
believed to have been the cradle of all that was best and deepest
in the philosophic or religious thought of Hellas. The gods of
the classic pantheon were identified with the gods of Egypt.<a id="noteref_2941" name="noteref_2941" href="#note_2941"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2941</span></span></a>
Pythagoras and the Orphic mystics had derived their inspiration
from the same source.<a id="noteref_2942" name="noteref_2942" href="#note_2942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2942</span></span></a> The conquests of Alexander
and the foundation of Alexandria had drawn to a focus the
philosophical or the religious ideas of East and West, of India,
Palestine, Persia, and Greece. At Alexandria were blended
and transformed all the philosophies and mythologies by the
subtle dialectic of Greece. The animal cult of Egypt, indeed,
was always a stumbling-block to Greek and Roman.<a id="noteref_2943" name="noteref_2943" href="#note_2943"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2943</span></span></a> It moved
the contempt and ridicule of comedian and satirist.<a id="noteref_2944" name="noteref_2944" href="#note_2944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2944</span></span></a> It was
an easy mark for the sneers of the crowd. Yet even the
divinised dog or ibis could find skilful, if not convinced,
defenders among the Greek eclectics, who lent all the forces of
Hellenic ingenuity to the cause of antiquarianism in religion.<a id="noteref_2945" name="noteref_2945" href="#note_2945"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2945</span></span></a>
Their native mythology was not without traces of zoolatry.
Their own god of healing, who became so popular in all lands,
was always connected in art and legend with the serpent. The
serpent of the Acropolis, which daily ate the holy wafer, was
the immemorial companion of the tutelary goddess of Athens.<a id="noteref_2946" name="noteref_2946" href="#note_2946"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2946</span></span></a>
Had not Zeus, in his many amours, found an easy access to
the fair victims of his love in animal forms? The Divine
virtues are only faintly imaged in animals which have their
uses in the world. If all religion is only symbolism, why
should not the multiform beneficence of the unseen Powers
be expressed in the form of creatures who give their service
and companionship to man, as fitly as in lifeless bronze or
marble?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although men might try to reconcile theology even
to a worship of animal forms, it was by very different spiritual
influences that Isis and Serapis won the devotion of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page572">[pg 572]</span><a name="Pg572" id="Pg572" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rustics of remote villages in Spain and Britain. The dog-headed
Anubis might perhaps be borne in processions.<a id="noteref_2947" name="noteref_2947" href="#note_2947"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2947</span></span></a> The
forms of sacred animals might be portrayed, along with those of
Io and Andromeda, on the frescoes of Herculaneum or Pompeii.<a id="noteref_2948" name="noteref_2948" href="#note_2948"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2948</span></span></a>
But the monuments of the Western provinces are, as a rule,
singularly free from the grossness of early Egyptian zoolatry.<a id="noteref_2949" name="noteref_2949" href="#note_2949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2949</span></span></a>
And there is hardly a hint of it in the famous picture of the
initiation of Lucius in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span> of Apuleius. In
that fascinating scene, Isis is the universal mother, Nature,
queen of the worlds of light and darkness, the eternal type
of all lesser divinities. And on inscriptions she appears as
the Power who <span class="tei tei-q">“is all in all.”</span><a id="noteref_2950" name="noteref_2950" href="#note_2950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2950</span></span></a> Whatever her special functions
may be, goddess of the spring, or of the sailor on the sea,
guardian of women in the pangs of motherhood, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen
of peace,”</span><a id="noteref_2951" name="noteref_2951" href="#note_2951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2951</span></span></a> guide and saviour of souls in the passage to the
world beyond the tomb, she remains the Supreme Power,
invoked by many names, with virtues and graces as various
as her names. And Serapis, in the later theology, is not the
president of any provincial territory in the universe. He is
not the lord of sea or earth or air only; he is lord of all the
elements, the dispenser of all good, the master of human life.
It is thus that Aristides hails him after his rescue from the
perils of the sea.<a id="noteref_2952" name="noteref_2952" href="#note_2952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2952</span></span></a> But although Serapis in many a monument
is enthroned beside Jupiter, Queen Isis is also supreme in
the world both of the living and the dead.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, although there is a very decided tendency to monotheism
in the Alexandrian religion, a tendency which appealed
strongly to minds like Plutarch, it did not succeed in altogether
breaking with polytheism and its attendant superstitions. The
attempted alliance of religion and philosophy was far from
complete. Philosophy, indeed, had substituted abstract theory
for the poetry of legend. It struggled hard to assert the
essential unity of the Divine nature. And Plutarch, in his
treatise on Isis, declares that God is one and the same in all
lands under whatever names He may be worshipped.<a id="noteref_2953" name="noteref_2953" href="#note_2953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2953</span></span></a> But the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page573">[pg 573]</span><a name="Pg573" id="Pg573" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>treatise shows at the same time how vague and unsettled still
was the theology of Alexandria, and how hard it found the task
of wedding Platonism to the haunting tradition of old idolatry.
Physics, metaphysics, etymology, are all employed with infinite
ingenuity to recover the secret meaning which it is assumed
that ancient wisdom had veiled under the forms of legend.
But arbitrary fancy plays far too large a part in these random
guesses, and system there is none, to bridge the gulf between
the Platonist eclectic and the superstitious masses. Isis
worship was in practice linked with all the reigning superstitions,
with divination, magic, astrology, oneiromancy.
Manetho, who was one of the founders of the worship of
Serapis, wrote a treatise for the Greek world on the influence
of the stars on human destiny.<a id="noteref_2954" name="noteref_2954" href="#note_2954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2954</span></span></a> Egyptian astrologists were
always in great demand. The emperors Otho and M. Aurelius
carried them in their train.<a id="noteref_2955" name="noteref_2955" href="#note_2955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2955</span></span></a> Many Roman ladies in sickness
would not take food or medicine till the safe hour had been
determined by inspecting the Petosiris.<a id="noteref_2956" name="noteref_2956" href="#note_2956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2956</span></span></a> The Isiac devotee
was an enthusiastic believer in dreams sent by his favourite
deities. On many inscriptions the record may be read of
these warnings of the night.<a id="noteref_2957" name="noteref_2957" href="#note_2957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2957</span></span></a> In the syncretism of the time,
Serapis came to be identified with the Greek god of healing,
and patients sleeping in Egyptian temples received in dreams
inspired prescriptions for their maladies.<a id="noteref_2958" name="noteref_2958" href="#note_2958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2958</span></span></a> Sometimes the deity
vouchsafed to confer miraculous powers of cure on a worshipper.
The sceptical good sense of Vespasian was persuaded by medical
courtiers at Alexandria to try the effect of his touch on the
blind and paralytic, who had a divine monition to seek the
aid of the emperor.<a id="noteref_2959" name="noteref_2959" href="#note_2959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2959</span></span></a> The cultivated Aristides had a firm
faith in these heaven-sent messages. He even believed that
Serapis could call back the dead to life.<a id="noteref_2960" name="noteref_2960" href="#note_2960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2960</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet Aristides, in his prose hymn to Serapis, gives us a
glimpse of the better side of that religion. After all, the
superstitions which clustered round it were the universal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page574">[pg 574]</span><a name="Pg574" id="Pg574" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beliefs of the age, prevalent among the most cultivated and
the most ignorant. The question for the modern student is
whether these Alexandrian worships provided real spiritual
sustenance for their devotees. And, in spite of many appearances
to the contrary, the impartial inquirer must come to
the conclusion that the cult of the Egyptian deities, through
its inner monotheism, its ideal of ascetic purity, its vision of a
great judgment and a life to come, was a real advance on
the popular religion of old Greece and Rome. Isis and Serapis,
along with Mithra, were preparing the Western world for
the religion which was to appease the long travail of humanity
by a more perfect vision of the Divine. It is impossible for a
modern man to realise the emotion which might be excited by
a symbolism like that of Demeter, or Mithra, or Isis, with
its roots in a gross heathen past. But no reader of Apuleius,
Plutarch, or Philostratus should fail to realise the surging
spiritual energy which, in the second and third centuries, was
seeking for expression and appeasement. It struck into
strange devious tracks, and often was deluded by phantasms of
old superstition glorified by a new spirit. But let us remember
the enduring strength of hereditary piety and ancient association,
and, under its influence, the magical skill of the religious
consciousness to maintain the link between widely severed
generations, by purifying the grossness of the past and
transforming things absurd and offensive into consecrated
vehicles of high spiritual sentiment. No one, who has read
in Apuleius the initiation of Lucius in the Isiac mysteries,
can doubt that the effect on the votary was profound and
elevating. Pious artistic skill was not wanting to heighten
emotion in Isis worship, as it is not disdained in our Christian
churches. But the prayer of thanksgiving offered by Lucius
might, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis mutandis</span></span>, be uttered by a new convert at a
camp-meeting, or a Breton peasant after her first communion.
It is the devout expression of the deep elementary religious
feelings of awe and gratitude, humility and joy, boundless
hope and trust. In the same tone, Aristides sings his prose
canticle to Serapis. There is not a memory of the brute
gods of the Nile. The Alexandrian god is now the equal or
counterpart of Zeus, the lord of life and death, who cares
for mortal men, who comforts, relieves, sustains. He is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page575">[pg 575]</span><a name="Pg575" id="Pg575" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>indeed a most awful power, yet one full of loving-kindness,
tenderness, and mercy.<a id="noteref_2961" name="noteref_2961" href="#note_2961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2961</span></span></a> In Plutarch we reach perhaps an even
more spiritual height. Osiris, who in old legend represented the
Nile, or the coarse fructifying powers of nature, passes into
the Eternal Love and Beauty, pure, passionless, remote from
any region of change or death, unapproachable in His ethereal
splendour, save, as in moments of inspired musing, we may
faintly touch Him as in a dream.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span> of Apuleius, the goddess who appears
in a vision to Lucius promises that, when his mortal course
is run, he shall find her illumining the Stygian gloom.
And, next to the maternal love with which she embraced her
votaries in this life, the great attraction of her cult was the
promise of a blessed future, through sacramental grace, which
she offered for the world to come. Serapis, too, is from the
beginning a god of the under world, a <span class="tei tei-q">“guide of souls,”</span> as
he is also their judge at the Great Assize.<a id="noteref_2962" name="noteref_2962" href="#note_2962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2962</span></span></a> The Orphic lore, the
mysteries of the Eleusinian goddesses and Dionysus, had for ages
taught a dim doctrine of immortality, under the veil of legend,
through the scenic effects of their dramatic mysteries. They
first revealed to the Greek race that the life to come was
the true life, for which the present was only a purgatorial
preparation. They taught, in whatever rude fashion, that
future beatitude could only be secured by a purification from
the stains of time.<a id="noteref_2963" name="noteref_2963" href="#note_2963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2963</span></span></a> The doctrine may have been drawn from
Egypt, and Egypt once more gave it fresh meaning and force.
The Alexandrian worship came with a deeper faith and more
impressive ritual, with dreams and monitory visions, with a
mystic lore, and the ascetic preparation for the holy mysteries,
with the final scene in the inner sanctuary, when the
votary seemed borne far beyond the limits of space and
time into ethereal distances.<a id="noteref_2964" name="noteref_2964" href="#note_2964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2964</span></span></a> The soul might, indeed,
have to pass through many bodies and mortal lives before
it reached the life eternal. But the motto of the Isiac faith,
inscribed on many tombs, was <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: normal">εὐψύχει</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“be of good courage,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page576">[pg 576]</span><a name="Pg576" id="Pg576" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“may Osiris give the water of refreshment.”</span><a id="noteref_2965" name="noteref_2965" href="#note_2965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2965</span></span></a> Everywhere
the lotus, image of immortality, in its calix opening at
every dawn, appears on symbols of the worship. And Harpocrates,
the god who has triumphed over death, appears
as the child issuing from the mystic flower. The Roman
practice of burning the dead might seem to separate for ever
the fate of the body from the spirit, although it is really a
question of more or less rapid resolution of the mortal frame
into its original elements. But, as we have seen, the man of
the early Empire became more and more anxious to preserve
undisturbed the <span class="tei tei-q">“handful of white dust”</span> rescued from the pyre,
and would invoke the wrath of Isis against the desecrator.<a id="noteref_2966" name="noteref_2966" href="#note_2966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2966</span></span></a> The
great object of many of the colleges was to secure their humble
members a niche in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">columbarium</span></span>. The Alexandrine faith in
immortality, by the grace of Isis and Serapis, probably did not
inquire too curiously into the manner of the resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Undoubtedly another secret of the popularity of the
Egyptian worships lay in their impressive ritual, the separation
of their clergy from the world, and in the comradeship of
the guilds in which their votaries were enrolled. Apuleius
has left us, in the initiation of Lucius at Cenchreae, and
again at Rome, a priceless picture of the Isiac ritual. Everything
in the ceremonial tends to kindle pious enthusiasm.
Sophocles and Pindar had extolled the blessedness of those
who had seen the mystic vision.<a id="noteref_2967" name="noteref_2967" href="#note_2967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2967</span></span></a> The experience of Lucius
would seem to confirm the testimony of the Greek poets.
When the goddess has promised him deliverance from
brutish form, and pledged him to strict obedience, Lucius is
inspired with the utmost ardour to join in <span class="tei tei-q">“the holy warfare.”</span>
He takes up his abode in the sacred precincts, he begs to be
admitted to full communion. But the venerable pontiff
requires him to await the sign of the divine will. Lucius
continues in fasting and prayer till the sign at last comes;
when it comes he hastens to the morning sacrifice. The
scrolls, covered with symbols of ancient Egypt, are brought in,
and then, before a crowd of the faithful, he is plunged in the
sacred font. Returning to the temple, as he lies prostrate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page577">[pg 577]</span><a name="Pg577" id="Pg577" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>before the image of the goddess in prayer, he has whispered to
him <span class="tei tei-q">“the unutterable words.”</span> Ten days more are spent in
strictest retreat and abstinence from pleasures of the flesh;
and then came the crowning rite, the solemn vigil in the inner
sanctuary. There, as at Eleusis, a vivid drama of a divine
death and resurrection probably passed before his eyes, in
flashing radiance and awful visions, amid gloom and the
tones of weird music. But the tale of what he saw and heard
could never be fully unfolded to mortal ear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There indeed are some sordid and suspicious traits in the
history of this worship. As in the case of the taurobolium,<a id="noteref_2968" name="noteref_2968" href="#note_2968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2968</span></span></a>
the mysteries of Isis and Serapis could not be enjoyed without
a considerable outlay. And Lucius found a difficulty in meeting
the expense.<a id="noteref_2969" name="noteref_2969" href="#note_2969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2969</span></span></a> But, whether in heathendom or Christendom,
a regular priesthood and an elaborate ritual cannot be
supported without the offerings of the faithful. There has
probably never been a religion in which the charge of venality
has not been levelled against the priests. But Lucius finds
here no stumbling-block. No material offering can repay the
goodness and love of the goddess. He feels towards her not
only reverence and gratitude, but the love of a son to a
Divine mother. Ascetic isolation has produced the natural
result of imaginative ecstasy and mystic exaltation. The long,
quiet hours of rapt devotion before the sacred figure in the
stillness of the shrine, the spectral visions of the supreme
hour of revelation, made a profound impression on a soul
which was deeply tainted by other visions of old-world sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The daily ritual of Isis, which seems to have been as
regular and complicated as that of the Catholic Church, produced
an immense effect on the Roman mind. Every day
there were two solemn offices, at which white-robed, tonsured
priests, with acolytes and assistants of every degree, officiated.<a id="noteref_2970" name="noteref_2970" href="#note_2970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2970</span></span></a>
The morning litany and sacrifice was an impressive service.
The crowd of worshippers thronged the space before the chapel
at the early dawn. The priest, ascending by a hidden stair,
drew apart the veil of the sanctuary,<a id="noteref_2971" name="noteref_2971" href="#note_2971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2971</span></span></a> and offered the holy image
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page578">[pg 578]</span><a name="Pg578" id="Pg578" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to their adoration. He then made the round of the altars,
reciting the litany, and sprinkling the holy water <span class="tei tei-q">“from the
secret spring.”</span> At two o’clock in the afternoon the passers by
could hear from the temple in the Campus Martius the chant
of vespers.<a id="noteref_2972" name="noteref_2972" href="#note_2972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2972</span></span></a> A fresco of Herculaneum gives us a picture of the
service. It is the adoration of the holy water, representing
in symbol the fructifying and deathless power of Osiris. A
priest, standing before the holy place, raises breast high a
sacred urn for the adoration of the crowd. The sacrifice is
smoking on the altar, and two choirs are chanting to the
accompaniment of the seistron and the flute.<a id="noteref_2973" name="noteref_2973" href="#note_2973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2973</span></span></a> Another fresco
from Herculaneum exhibits a bearded, dark-skinned figure,
crowned with the lotus, in the attitude of dancing before a
throng of spectators to the sound of music. It is plausibly
conjectured that we have here a pantomimic representation of
the passion of Osiris and its joyful close.<a id="noteref_2974" name="noteref_2974" href="#note_2974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2974</span></span></a> There was much
solemn pomp and striking scenic effect in this public ceremonial.
But it is clear from Apuleius, that an important part of
worship was also long silent meditation before the image of
the goddess. The poets speak of devotees seated thus before
the altar, and in the temple at Pompeii a bench has been
found which, from its position, was probably occupied by such
silent worshippers.<a id="noteref_2975" name="noteref_2975" href="#note_2975"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2975</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great festivals of the Egyptian worship were the
blessing of the sacred vessel on the fifth of March, and the
celebration of the quest and finding of Osiris in November.
The anniversary of the death and rising again of the god was
strictly observed by large numbers, especially among women.
Pagan and Christian writers have alike ridiculed the theatrical
grief and joy for a god so often found, so often lost.<a id="noteref_2976" name="noteref_2976" href="#note_2976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2976</span></span></a> The
death of Osiris at the hands of Typhon, the rending of the
divine form, and the dispersion of the lacerated remains, were
passionately lamented in sympathy with the mourning Isis.
With effusive grief the devotees beat their breasts and lacerated
their arms, and followed in eager search. When on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page579">[pg 579]</span><a name="Pg579" id="Pg579" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>third day the god had been found and restored, the joyful
event was hailed with extravagant gladness, and celebrated
by a banquet of the initiated. For some of these holy
days the rubrics prescribed a long preparation of fasting and
ascetic restraint. But that a general strictness of life was not
required of the Isiac votary, at least under the early Empire,
may be inferred from the fact that the frail Cynthias and
Delias in Propertius and Tibullus were among the most regular
in ritual observance.<a id="noteref_2977" name="noteref_2977" href="#note_2977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2977</span></span></a> The festival of the holy vessel of Isis,
which marked the opening of navigation, and received the
benediction of the goddess, was, in the early Empire, observed
with solemn pomp and enthusiasm by the coast towns of the
Mediterranean. A brilliantly vivid description of such a
scene at Cenchreae has been left by Apuleius. It was a
great popular carnival, in which a long procession, masquerading
in the most fantastic and various costumes, conducted the
sacred ship to the shore. Women in white robes scattered
flowers and perfumes along the way. A throng of both
sexes bore torches and tapers, to symbolise the reign of
the Mother of the stars. The music of flute and pipe
meanwhile filled the air with sacred symphonies, and a
band of youths in snow-white vestments chanted a hymn.
Wave upon wave came the throng of those who had been
admitted to full communion, all clad in linen, and the men
marked with the tonsure. They were followed by the priests,
each bearing some symbol of the many powers and virtues
of the goddess, the boat-shaped lamp, the <span class="tei tei-q">“altars of succour,”</span>
the palm of gold, the wand of Mercury. In a pix were
borne the holy mysteries, and, last of all, the most venerable
symbol, a small urn of shining gold and adorned in
subtle workmanship with figures of Egyptian legend.<a id="noteref_2978" name="noteref_2978" href="#note_2978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2978</span></span></a> This
holy vase, containing the water of the sacred river, which was
an emanation from Osiris,<a id="noteref_2979" name="noteref_2979" href="#note_2979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2979</span></span></a> closed the procession. Arrived at
the margin of the sea, the chief priest consecrated the sacred
vessel with solemn form and litany, and named it with the holy
name. Adorned with gold and citrus wood and pictures of
old legend, it spread its white sails to the breeze, and bore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page580">[pg 580]</span><a name="Pg580" id="Pg580" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into the distance the vows and offerings of the faithful for the
safety of those upon the deep.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The oriental religions of the imperial period were distinguished
from the native religion of Latium by the possession
of a numerous and highly organised priesthood, and an
intensely sacerdotal spirit.<a id="noteref_2980" name="noteref_2980" href="#note_2980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2980</span></span></a> In an age of growing religious
faith, this characteristic gave them enormous power. The
priest became a necessary medium of intercourse with God.
It is also one of the many traits in the later paganism,
which prepared and softened the transition to the reign of
the mediaeval Church. It would be tedious and unprofitable
to enumerate the various grades of the Isiac priesthood.
There were high priests of conspicuous dignity, who were
also called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetae</span></span>.<a id="noteref_2981" name="noteref_2981" href="#note_2981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2981</span></span></a> But ordinary priests could perform
many of their functions.<a id="noteref_2982" name="noteref_2982" href="#note_2982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2982</span></span></a> There were interpreters of
dreams, dressers and keepers of the sacred wardrobe of the
goddess,<a id="noteref_2983" name="noteref_2983" href="#note_2983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2983</span></span></a> whose duties must have been onerous, if we may
judge from the list of robes and jewels and sacred furniture
preserved in inscriptions or recovered from the ruins of Isiac
shrines.<a id="noteref_2984" name="noteref_2984" href="#note_2984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2984</span></span></a> It has been remarked that the roaming Visigoths
in southern Gaul must have had a rare spoil if they had the
fortune to light on one of the great temples of Isis. The
scribe of the Pastophori, in Apuleius, is also an important
officer. He summons the sacred convocation, and recites the
<span class="tei tei-q">“bidding prayer”</span> for the Emperor and all subjects, in their
several places and stations.<a id="noteref_2985" name="noteref_2985" href="#note_2985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2985</span></span></a> Music took a large part in the
ritual; there was hymn-singing to the sound of flutes, harp,
and cymbal; and the chanters and paeanists of Serapis
formed an order by themselves.<a id="noteref_2986" name="noteref_2986" href="#note_2986"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2986</span></span></a> The prayer which Lucius
offers to the goddess, in Apuleius, has been arranged as a
metrical litany.<a id="noteref_2987" name="noteref_2987" href="#note_2987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2987</span></span></a> Women often appear in inscriptions and in
our texts as priestesses, and had a prominent place in all
solemn ritual.<a id="noteref_2988" name="noteref_2988" href="#note_2988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2988</span></span></a> And it is evident that, with all its sacerdotalism,
the worship gave full recognition to devout wor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page581">[pg 581]</span><a name="Pg581" id="Pg581" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shippers of every degree and sex. All who are devoted to
the service have their place and function. The initiated might
even wear the tonsure in the ordinary lay life. To do this,
indeed, needed some courage, in the face of Roman ridicule.
But the religious were, from the earliest times in Greece and
Italy, associated for mutual support in sacred guilds, designated
by various names, Isiaci or Pastophori or Anubiaci.
In the third century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, such societies are found in Ceos
and Peiraeus.<a id="noteref_2989" name="noteref_2989" href="#note_2989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2989</span></span></a> On the walls of Pompeii they have left their
appeals to the electors to vote on behalf of candidates for
the aedileship.<a id="noteref_2990" name="noteref_2990" href="#note_2990"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2990</span></span></a> They were organised on the usual lines of
the ancient colleges, divided into decuries, with a director and
a treasurer, a <span class="tei tei-q">“father”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“mother,”</span> or a patron at their
head.<a id="noteref_2991" name="noteref_2991" href="#note_2991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2991</span></span></a> The Isiac guilds must have had a powerful influence
in the diffusion of the religion of Alexandria. But they
also were probably one cause of the suspicion so long entertained
for that worship by the Republican government, and
they only asserted their full strength in the second century,
when the colleges in general received the tacit sanction of the
emperors. That the emperors felt little fear of these foreign
sacred corporations became clear when an emperor actually
took the tonsure of Isis.<a id="noteref_2992" name="noteref_2992" href="#note_2992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2992</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Isiac system was energetic and self-assertive, but it
can hardly be called dangerous or revolutionary. It threw
many of the old gods into the shade, but its syncretism also
found a place for many of them. Its inner monotheism, after
the fashion of those days, had open arms of charity for all the
ancient gods. One of the priests of Isis might be called
Iacchagogus or Mithra;<a id="noteref_2993" name="noteref_2993" href="#note_2993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2993</span></span></a> statues of Dionysus and Venus and
Priapus stood in the court of the Isium at Pompeii.<a id="noteref_2994" name="noteref_2994" href="#note_2994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2994</span></span></a> The
Isis of Apuleius proclaims her identity with nearly all the
great powers of classical legend, and gathers them into herself.
But Isis identifies only to conquer and absorb. And her
priesthood formed an aggressive and powerful caste. The
sacerdotal colleges of the Latin religion were never, except in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page582">[pg 582]</span><a name="Pg582" id="Pg582" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the case of the Vestals, separated from ordinary life. The
highest pontificate was held by busy laymen, by consuls or
emperors or great soldiers. After the performance of his part
in some great rite, the Roman priest returned to his civic
place and duties. And in Greece, in the third and second
centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, even the Isiac priesthood was held only for a
year, or even for a month; and the sacred processions at
one time needed the authorisation of the local council at
Samos.<a id="noteref_2995" name="noteref_2995" href="#note_2995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2995</span></span></a> But when we come to the days of Apuleius, all
this is changed. The chief priest at Cenchreae is evidently
a great ecclesiastic, bearing the sacred Eastern name of
Mithra.<a id="noteref_2996" name="noteref_2996" href="#note_2996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2996</span></span></a> He has given up ordinary civic life, and has
probably abandoned his Greek name to take a new name
<span class="tei tei-q">“in religion.”</span> Every day two solemn services at least
have to be performed in the temple, besides the private
direction of souls, which had evidently become a regular
part of the priestly functions. Attached to the great
temples, and close to the altar, there is a <span class="tei tei-q">“clergy house”</span>
where the ministers are lodged. It is called the Pastophorion,
and its chambers have been traced in the débris
of the temple at Pompeii.<a id="noteref_2997" name="noteref_2997" href="#note_2997"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2997</span></span></a> One of these presbyteries was
the scene of the seduction which convulsed the religious
world in the reign of Tiberius, and which sent so many pious
exiles to the solitudes of Sardinia. The ministers of Isis and
Serapis are marked off by the tonsure and the Isiac habit,
which meet us in the pages of poets from Tibullus to Juvenal,<a id="noteref_2998" name="noteref_2998" href="#note_2998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2998</span></span></a>
and in the frescoes of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The
abstinence, which was required as a preparation for communion
in ordinary votaries, was a lifelong obligation on the priest.
The use of woollen garments, of wine, pork, fish, and certain
vegetables, was absolutely forbidden to them.<a id="noteref_2999" name="noteref_2999" href="#note_2999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2999</span></span></a> Chastity was
essential in the celebrant of the holy mysteries, and even
Tertullian holds up the priests of Isis as a reproachful example
of continence to professing followers of Christ. The priesthood
is no longer a secondary concern; it absorbs a man’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page583">[pg 583]</span><a name="Pg583" id="Pg583" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whole life, sets him apart within the sanctuary as the dispenser
of sacred privileges, with the awful power of revealing the
mystery of eternity, and preparing souls to meet the great
ordeal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It does not need much imagination to understand the
fascination of Isis and Serapis for a people who had outgrown
a severe and sober, but an uninspiring faith. They came to
the West at the crisis of a great spiritual and political
revolution, with the charm of foreign mystery and the
immemorial antiquity of a land whose annals ran back to
ages long before Rome and Athens were even villages. But
with antique charm, the religion combined the moral and
spiritual ideas of generations which had outgrown the gross
symbolism of Nature worship. The annual festivals might
preserve the memory of the myth, which in its grossness and
brutal tragedy once pictured the fructifying influence of the
mysterious river on the lands which awaited his visitations,
or the waning force of vegetative power and solar warmth.
But Serapis, the new god of the Ptolemies, became the lord of
life and death, the guide and saviour of souls, the great judge
of all in the other world, an awful power, yet more inclined to
mercy than to judgment.<a id="noteref_3000" name="noteref_3000" href="#note_3000"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3000</span></span></a> And Isis rose to equally boundless
sway, and one of greater tenderness. Powers above and powers
below alike wait on her will: she treads Tartarus under her
feet, and yet she embraces all, and specially the weak and
miserable, in the arms of her charity.<a id="noteref_3001" name="noteref_3001" href="#note_3001"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3001</span></span></a> Above all, she has the
secret of the unseen world, and can lighten for her worshipper
the Stygian gloom. But the Isiac, like the Orphic revelation,
while it gave a blessed promise for the life to come, attached
grave conditions to the pledge. In this brief time of probation,
the soul must prepare itself under ghostly guidance for
the great trial. Sacrament and mystery lent their aid to
fortify the worshipper in the face of death, but, to derive their
full virtue, he must exercise himself in temperance, abjure the
pleasures of the senses, and purify himself for the vision of
God.<a id="noteref_3002" name="noteref_3002" href="#note_3002"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3002</span></span></a> The sacred ritual of the Egyptian might captivate the
senses and imagination by its pomp and music, its steaming
altars, and many-coloured symbolism. But in the stillness of
the sanctuary the worshipper was trained to find his moments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page584">[pg 584]</span><a name="Pg584" id="Pg584" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of purest and most exalted devotion in silent meditation
before the Queen of heaven and the shades. The <a name="corr584" id="corr584" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">lonely,</span>
the weak, and the desolate found in the holy guilds succour
and consolation, with a place in the ritual of her solemn
seasons, which bound each to each in the love of a Divine
Mother.

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">THE RELIGION OF MITHRA</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of all the oriental religions which attracted the devotion of
the West in the last three centuries of the Empire, that of
Mithra was the most powerful. It is also the system which
for various reasons has the greatest interest for the modern
student. It is perhaps the highest and most striking example
of the last efforts of paganism to reconcile itself to the great
moral and spiritual movement which was setting steadily, and
with growing momentum, towards purer conceptions of God, of
man’s relations to Him, and of the life to come. It is also the
greatest effort of syncretism to absorb, without extinguishing,
the gods of the classic pantheon in a cult which was almost
monotheistic, to transform old forms of nature worship and
cosmic symbolism into a system which should provide at once
some form of moral discipline and real satisfaction for spiritual
wants. In this effort, Mithraism was not so much impeded
by a heritage of coarse legend as the worships of Pessinus
and Alexandria. It was indeed sprung from the same order
of religious thought as they. It could never detach itself
from its source as a cult of the powers of nature.<a id="noteref_3003" name="noteref_3003" href="#note_3003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3003</span></span></a> But the
worship of the Sun, with which Mithra was inseparably connected,
was the purest and most natural form of devotion,
if elemental powers were to be worshipped at all. And heathendom
tended more and more under the Empire to fix its
devotion on the source of all light and life. The Sun was to
Plato the highest material symbol of the Infinite Good. Neo-Pythagoreanism
and Neo-Platonism regarded him as the sacred
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page586">[pg 586]</span><a name="Pg586" id="Pg586" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>image of the power beyond human ken.<a id="noteref_3004" name="noteref_3004" href="#note_3004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3004</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Before religion,”</span>
it has been said, <span class="tei tei-q">“had reached the point of proclaiming that
God must be sought in the realm of the ideal and the absolute
outside the world of sense, the one rational and scientific cult
was that of the Sun.”</span><a id="noteref_3005" name="noteref_3005" href="#note_3005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3005</span></span></a> Heliolatry also harmonised with
absolutism in the State, as the old Persian kings and their
imitators, the emperors of the third century, clearly perceived.
The great temple of the Sun, which Aurelian, the son of a
priestess of the deity, founded in the Campus Martius, with its
high pontiffs and stately ritual, did honour not only to the
great lord of the heavenly spheres, but to the monarch who
was the august image of his power upon earth and who was
endued with his special grace.<a id="noteref_3006" name="noteref_3006" href="#note_3006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3006</span></span></a> The power of Mithra in the
fourth century lay in the fact that, while it was tender and
tolerant to the old national worships, and never broke with the
inner spirit of heathenism, it created an all-embracing system
which rose above all national barriers, which satisfied the
philosophic thought of the age in its mysticism, and gave
comfort and a hope of immortality through its sacraments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mithra was one of the most ancient and venerable objects
of pagan devotion, as he was one of the last to be dethroned.
In faint outline he can be traced to the cradle of the Aryan
race.<a id="noteref_3007" name="noteref_3007" href="#note_3007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3007</span></span></a> In the Vedas he is a god of light, and, as the god of
truth, who hates all falsehood, he has the germ of that moral
character which grew into a great force in the last age of his
worship in the West. In the Avestas, the sacred books of the
religion of Iran, which, however late their redaction, still enshrine
a very ancient creed, Mithra has the same well-defined
personality. He is the radiant god who seems to emerge
from the rocky summits of eastern mountains at dawn, who
careers through heaven with a team of four white horses; yet
he is not sun or moon or any star, but a spirit of light, ever
wakeful, watching with a thousand eyes, whom nothing can
escape and nothing deceive.<a id="noteref_3008" name="noteref_3008" href="#note_3008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3008</span></span></a> And so, while he gives warmth
and increase to the earth, and health and wealth to men, he is
also from the beginning a moral power. He confers wisdom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page587">[pg 587]</span><a name="Pg587" id="Pg587" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and honour and a clear conscience and concord. He wages a
truceless war with the evil powers of darkness, and guards his
faithful soldiers against the craft of the enemy. He is the
friend and consoler of the poor; he is the mediator between
earth and heaven; he is the lord of the world to come.<a id="noteref_3009" name="noteref_3009" href="#note_3009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3009</span></span></a> But
his place in the Zoroastrian hierarchy was not always equally
high. At one time he was only one of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">yazatas</span></span>, who were
created by the supreme Ormuzd.<a id="noteref_3010" name="noteref_3010" href="#note_3010"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3010</span></span></a> But Mithra has still the
attributes of guardian and saviour; he is approached with
sacrifice, libation, ablution, and litany, as in the latest days of
his power in the West. And again a higher place is given to
him; he is the vicegerent of the remote, ineffable Ormuzd, the
mediator through whom the supreme power crushes evil
demons, and wages war with Ahriman; he is invoked in the
same prayers side by side with the Supreme. The Great
Kings, especially the later, regard Mithra as their special
guardian, swear by him in their most solemn oaths,<a id="noteref_3011" name="noteref_3011" href="#note_3011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3011</span></span></a> and call
upon him in the hour of battle. If he was the god of the
humble and afflicted, he was also the god of the prince and
warrior noble, and so we shall find him at the end.

The Persian conquest of Babylon had lasting effects on
the religion of Mithra. There he encountered a sacerdotal
system which had its roots in an immemorial civilisation. The
conquerors, as so often happens, were to some extent subdued
by the vanquished.<a id="noteref_3012" name="noteref_3012" href="#note_3012"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3012</span></span></a> Syncretism set in; the deities of the
two races were reconciled and identified. The magical arts
and the astrolatry of the valley of the Euphrates imposed
themselves on the purer Mazdean faith, and never relaxed
their hold, although they failed to check its development as a
moral system. Ormuzd was confounded with Bel, Mithra
with Shamash or the Sun-god. The astral and solar lore,
the faith in mystic numbers, which had been cultivated in
Babylonia through many generations, took its place in the
theology of Mithra, and they have left their mark in many a
chapel on the Danube and the Rhine. Yet Mithra, identified
with the Sun at Babylon, was never absorbed in the cult
of the solar deity in the West.<a id="noteref_3013" name="noteref_3013" href="#note_3013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3013</span></span></a> On many of the later

equals and allies. Yet the connection of Mithra with Babylon
is never forgotten either by Greeks or Romans. Claudian
connects him with the mysteries of Bel.<a id="noteref_3014" name="noteref_3014" href="#note_3014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3014</span></span></a> The priest who,

With the destruction of the Persian empire and the diffusion
of Magian influence in Asia Minor, the worship arrived at its
last stage before entering on the conquest of the West.
The monarchs of Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, and Commagene,
who claimed descent from the Achaemenids, were
politic or enthusiastic votaries of the religious traditions of
Iran.<a id="noteref_3016" name="noteref_3016" href="#note_3016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3016</span></span></a> While they reverenced Ormuzd and Anaitis, Mithra
was their special patron, as he was to Artaxerxes.<a id="noteref_3017" name="noteref_3017" href="#note_3017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3017</span></span></a> Mithra’s
name appears constantly in the names of royal houses, such as
Mithradates and Mithrobarzanes. The inscription on the tomb
of Antiochus of Commagene, who boasted of his descent from
Darius the son of Hystaspes, records the endowment of solemn
Persian rites, and combines the names of Ormuzd and Zeus, of
Apollo and Mithra.<a id="noteref_3018" name="noteref_3018" href="#note_3018"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3018</span></span></a> In the submergence of national barriers
which followed the fall of the Persian monarchy, and under
the influence of Greek philosophy, that process of syncretism
began in Asia Minor which was destined to produce such
momentous results in the third and fourth centuries. But the
Mazdean faith, strong in its associations with the ancient
sources of spiritual enlightenment in the East, never succumbed
to the western paganism. The classical gods might be admitted
to the Mazdean heaven; Zeus might be confounded with
Ormuzd; Anaitis might find an analogue in Artemis Tauropolus.
But the ancient name of Mithra was never profaned
in the liturgy by any translation.<a id="noteref_3019" name="noteref_3019" href="#note_3019"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3019</span></span></a> It was chiefly perhaps in
Phrygia and Lydia that alien worships produced a lasting
effect in modifying the Persian theology. The pure morality
of the Mithraist creed might seem to have little in common
with the orgies of the devotees of Attis and the Great Mother.
But religious sentiment has a miraculous power both to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page589">[pg 589]</span><a name="Pg589" id="Pg589" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>reject and to transmute. The costume and Phrygian cap of
Attis appear on all the monuments of Mithra to the end.
And, although it is a subject of debate, the taurobolium, that
baptism of blood which was the most impressive rite of the
later paganism, was, in all probability, early borrowed by
Mithra from the ritual of Phrygia.<a id="noteref_3020" name="noteref_3020" href="#note_3020"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3020</span></span></a> The pine, the emblem of
immortality, which is so prominent in the scenes of mourning
for Attis,<a id="noteref_3021" name="noteref_3021" href="#note_3021"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3021</span></span></a> also has a place in the sculptured remains of the
Persian chapels. And the title Menotyrannus, a title of Attis,
which is given to the Persian god on many slabs, recalls his
passage through the same region.<a id="noteref_3022" name="noteref_3022" href="#note_3022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3022</span></span></a> But Greek art had a more
powerful and enduring effect on the future of Mithra than
any of these accretions. Probably the ancient Persian faith
recoiled from any material image of its divine powers,<a id="noteref_3023" name="noteref_3023" href="#note_3023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3023</span></span></a> although
here also Assyria may have corrupted its purity. But when
Hellenic imagination began to play around the Mazdean gods,
the result was certain. The victorious Mithra was clothed
with human form, and his legend was fixed for ever by some
nameless Pergamene artist, who drew his inspiration from the
<span class="tei tei-q">“steer-slaying Victory”</span> of Athens.<a id="noteref_3024" name="noteref_3024" href="#note_3024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3024</span></span></a> The group in which the
youthful hero, his mantle blown back by the wind, with a
Phrygian cap upon his head, kneels on the shoulder of the
bull, as he buries his poniard in its throat, was for four
centuries reproduced in countless chapels from the mouth of
the Danube to the Solway. That symbolic scene, conveying
so many meanings in its hieratic rigidity, became to the pious
Mithraist what the image of the Divine Figure on the Cross
has been for so many centuries to the devout Catholic.

The revelation of the spread of Mithra worship in the
Roman Empire is one of the greatest triumphs of modern
archaeology. Only faint notices of the cult are found in
Herodotus, Xenophon, and Strabo.<a id="noteref_3025" name="noteref_3025" href="#note_3025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3025</span></span></a> Quintus Curtius knew the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page590">[pg 590]</span><a name="Pg590" id="Pg590" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may conclude that he knew something of the service in Mithra’s
grottoes, and that he had seen the figure of the <span class="tei tei-q">“bull slaying”</span>
god.<a id="noteref_3027" name="noteref_3027" href="#note_3027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3027</span></span></a> Plutarch knows Mithra as the mediator between Ormuzd

native Samosata; he knew the figure with the candys and
tiara, and, from the sneer at the god’s ignorance of Greek, he
may perhaps have heard the old Mazdean litany.<a id="noteref_3029" name="noteref_3029" href="#note_3029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3029</span></span></a> But he had
probably little notion of the hold which Mithra had already
obtained on the farthest regions of the West. Still less had
he any prevision of his great destiny in the third and fourth
centuries. Literature, down to the Antonine age, teaches us
little of the character and strength of the worship. Without
votive inscriptions and the many ruins of his chapels, along
with the indignant, yet anxious, invective of the Christian
apologists, we should never have known how near the Persian
god came to justifying his title of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unconquered.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible to fix the precise date when the worship
of Mithra first crossed the Aegean. The silence of inscriptions
must not indeed be taken as proving that he had no devotees
in Italy before the Flavian age. A famous passage in
Plutarch’s life of Pompey would seem to refer the first
appearance of the worship in the West to the conquest of the
pirates of Cilicia by Pompey, in 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span><a id="noteref_3030" name="noteref_3030" href="#note_3030"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3030</span></span></a> A religion of the
alien and the slave may well have been long domiciled in
Italy before it attracted general notice. And there may have
been humble worshippers of Mithra at Rome or Puteoli even in
the days of Julius Caesar. The Mithraist inscription of the
time of Tiberius is now admitted to be a forgery.<a id="noteref_3031" name="noteref_3031" href="#note_3031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3031</span></span></a> But from
his reign may probably be dated the first serious inroads of the
cult. Under Tiberius, Cappadocia was incorporated in the
Empire, and Pontus under Nero; Commagene, the home of
Jupiter Dolichenus, who was a firm ally of Mithra, was
finally absorbed in the reign of Vespasian.<a id="noteref_3032" name="noteref_3032" href="#note_3032"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3032</span></span></a> The official
organisation of these districts, and the constant intercourse
established between central Asia Minor and the capital, must
have opened many channels for the importation of new forms
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page591">[pg 591]</span><a name="Pg591" id="Pg591" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of devotion from the East. Almost in the very year in which
Statius was penning his verses about Mithra in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thebaid</span></span>, a
freedman of the Flavian house erected a tablet to the god on
the Esquiline,<a id="noteref_3033" name="noteref_3033" href="#note_3033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3033</span></span></a> and soldiers of the East carried his mysteries to
the camps on the Danube. The 15th Legion, which had
fought under Corbulo against the Parthians, and taken part
in the conquest of Palestine in 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>, in the first years of
the reign of Vespasian, established the worship of Mithra at
Carnuntum in Pannonia, which became henceforth the sacred
city of Mithra in the West.<a id="noteref_3034" name="noteref_3034" href="#note_3034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3034</span></span></a> In 102 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> a marble group
was dedicated by the slave of a praetorian prefect of Trajan.<a id="noteref_3035" name="noteref_3035" href="#note_3035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3035</span></span></a>
It is probable that at Ostia we have records of the cult from
the year 162.<a id="noteref_3036" name="noteref_3036" href="#note_3036"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3036</span></span></a> The Mithraeum, found under the church of
S. Clement at Rome, has yielded an inscription of the last
years of Antoninus Pius. That emperor erected a temple to
Mithra at Ostia.<a id="noteref_3037" name="noteref_3037" href="#note_3037"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3037</span></span></a> Rome and Ostia were probably the
earliest points in Italy invaded by the Persian worship.
All the conditions were favourable to an early and rapid
propagation of the cult in the capital of the world.
Soldiers from the East would be serving in the garrison,
or settled after their release from service. Eastern slaves
swarmed in all the great houses, including that of the emperor.
A large proportion of the dedications are made by men of
servile origin, and the very name of the dedicator would often
be enough to indicate his nationality. More than 100 inscriptions,
more than 75 pieces of Mithraist sculpture, with the
ruins of many chapels of the god, attest his powerful influence
at Rome.<a id="noteref_3038" name="noteref_3038" href="#note_3038"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3038</span></span></a> Ostia which, since the reconstruction of Trajan, had

port had at least four temples of Mithra in the second century,
and it is significant of the alliance between the two worships,
that a Mithraeum there was built close to a shrine of the
Great Mother,<a id="noteref_3040" name="noteref_3040" href="#note_3040"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3040</span></span></a> and that members of the college of the Dendrophori
sometimes made offerings and dedications to Mithra.<a id="noteref_3041" name="noteref_3041" href="#note_3041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3041</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page592">[pg 592]</span><a name="Pg592" id="Pg592" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The remains at Ostia disclose some other indications of the
prevailing syncretism. The Roman Sylvanus has a niche in
one Mithraeum, and, in another, Saturn and Jupiter, Mars,
Mercury and Venus, are figured beside the purely Eastern
symbols of the planets and the signs of the zodiac.<a id="noteref_3042" name="noteref_3042" href="#note_3042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3042</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inner secret of that rapid propaganda we shall never
fully know. But we can discover with tolerable certainty the
kind of people who carried the gospel of Mithra to the most
remote parts of the western world. The soldiers were his most
zealous missionaries.<a id="noteref_3043" name="noteref_3043" href="#note_3043"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3043</span></span></a> Drafted from Cappadocia or Commagene,
and quartered, far from his home, in a camp on the Danube or
in the Black Forest, the legionary clung to the worship of his
native East, and was eager to admit his comrades to fellowship
in its rites. The appearance of Mithraism in certain places can
be traced directly to the quartering of a legion which had been
recruited from the countries which were the original home of
the worship. Officers of eastern birth on promotion passed into
other corps, and extended the influence of the East.<a id="noteref_3044" name="noteref_3044" href="#note_3044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3044</span></span></a> Centurions
retiring from active service became apostles of the movement
in the places where they settled. Syrian merchants, who were
still found at Orleans in the time of the Merovingians, with all
the fanaticism of their race popularised their native worships
in the ports of Italy, Gaul, along the coasts of the Adriatic,
and among the centres of commerce on the Danube or the
Rhine.<a id="noteref_3045" name="noteref_3045" href="#note_3045"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3045</span></span></a> The civil servants of the emperor, clerks and commissaries
of every degree, procurators and agents of great
estates, who were often men of servile origin, have left many
traces of their zeal in spreading the Persian worship both
throughout Italy and in countries north of the Alps.<a id="noteref_3046" name="noteref_3046" href="#note_3046"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3046</span></span></a> The

any other.<a id="noteref_3047" name="noteref_3047" href="#note_3047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3047</span></span></a> It was largely drawn from Cappadocia, Pontus,
and Phrygia, those regions where the religion of Mithra had
taken deep root before it passed into Europe. And, like the
Christian, the religion of Mithra was, at the outset of its
career, a religion of the poor and humble. It was only in
the second century that it achieved the conquest of the court
and the educated classes. It was probably through slaves that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page593">[pg 593]</span><a name="Pg593" id="Pg593" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it found its way into remote corners of Apulia, Lucania, or

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The stages in the spread of the Mithraist rites throughout
Italy cannot be clearly traced. But in the second century the
cult was established not only in Campania, Capreae, and Ischia,
but in lonely country places in Southern Italy.<a id="noteref_3049" name="noteref_3049" href="#note_3049"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3049</span></span></a> It had
spread to a circle of towns around Rome—Lanuvium, Alba,
Velitrae, Labici, and Praeneste.<a id="noteref_3050" name="noteref_3050" href="#note_3050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3050</span></span></a> Borne by traders, imperial
officers or slaves, it followed the line of the great roads to
the north. Thus we can trace its march along the Via Cassia
through Etruria, at Volsinii, Arretium, and Florence.<a id="noteref_3051" name="noteref_3051" href="#note_3051"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3051</span></span></a> It
arrived at Pisa probably by sea. Along the Flaminian Way, it
may be followed through Interamna, Spoletium, and Sentinum
to Bononia. At Nersae, in the Aequian territory, the cult must
have been of some antiquity in 172 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span><a id="noteref_3052" name="noteref_3052" href="#note_3052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3052</span></span></a> For, in that year
the treasurer of the town, a man probably of the slave class,
restored a chapel which had fallen into ruins. The roll of
the patrons of a Mithraist society at Sentinum has come
down to us, with the names of slaves or freedmen among its
members.<a id="noteref_3053" name="noteref_3053" href="#note_3053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3053</span></span></a> In Gallia Cisalpina the traces of Mithra are less
frequent. Milan, already growing to its great destiny in the
fourth century, and Aquileia, are the chief seats of the Persian
cult. Aquileia has yielded a large number of inscriptions.
From its situation at the mouth of the Po, as the great
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">entrepôt</span></span> for the trade between the Adriatic and the Danubian
provinces, it must have powerfully stimulated the diffusion of
the worship.<a id="noteref_3054" name="noteref_3054" href="#note_3054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3054</span></span></a> It is curious, however, that the passes of the
Alps have yielded richer booty to the investigator in this field
than the plains of Lombardy. In the mountain valleys leading
to Rhaetia and Noricum, as well as in those above the
Italian lakes, many relics of this far-spreading religion have been
given to the light.<a id="noteref_3055" name="noteref_3055" href="#note_3055"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3055</span></span></a> A temple of Mithra has been discovered
near Trent, in the valley of the Adige. In the Tyrol and
Carinthia sacred grottoes, buried among woods and rocks, have
disclosed bas-reliefs, sculptured with the traditionary figures of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page594">[pg 594]</span><a name="Pg594" id="Pg594" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Persian legend. They were probably frequented by the faithful
down to the reign of Valentinian.<a id="noteref_3056" name="noteref_3056" href="#note_3056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3056</span></span></a> Throughout Noricum and
Pannonia imperial functionaries or agents of private enterprise,
procurators, clerks of the treasury, custom-house officers, or
eastern freedmen and slaves, have left many traces of their
devotion to the Persian god.<a id="noteref_3057" name="noteref_3057" href="#note_3057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3057</span></span></a> Thus, everywhere along the
great roads which radiated from Aquileia to the markets or
strong places upon the Danube, the votary of Mithra would
find in the days of the Antonines many a shrine, stately or
humble, where he could refresh his piety by the way.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Greek provinces have yielded but few memorials of the
worship of Mithra. But, from the mouth of the Danube to
the north of England his triumphant march can be traced, with
only a break here and there. He follows the line of the rivers
or the great roads, through the frontier camps or the centres
of Roman commerce. Firmly seated at Tomi and the ports of
the Black Sea, Mithra has not left many traces, so far as
exploration has gone, in Thrace and Macedonia.<a id="noteref_3058" name="noteref_3058" href="#note_3058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3058</span></span></a> Nor have the

Pannonia abounds with interesting remains of Mithra, not
only in the great seats of Roman power on the Danube, but in
places far in the interior.  And in this province can be
distinctly traced not only the progress of the military propaganda,
but the dates, with approximate accuracy, when the
mysteries of Mithra were first introduced.<a id="noteref_3064" name="noteref_3064" href="#note_3064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3064</span></span></a> Aquincum and
Carnuntum were the chief seats of the Persian worship on
the Danube. In the former town, the god had at least five
chapels in the third century. There were at least four in the
territory of Carnuntum, one of them being closely connected
with that of the allied deity, Jupiter Dolichenus of Commagene.<a id="noteref_3065" name="noteref_3065" href="#note_3065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3065</span></span></a>
The original votaries of the reign of Vespasian had
been contented with a rude grotto, partially formed by the
configuration of the rocks, the intervals being filled in with
masonry.<a id="noteref_3066" name="noteref_3066" href="#note_3066"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3066</span></span></a> This structure in the third century was replaced

There can be little doubt that the spread of Mithraism in
Pannonia was chiefly the work of two Legions, the II. Adjutrix
and XV. Apollinaris, both largely recruited from Commagene
or Cappadocia.<a id="noteref_3068" name="noteref_3068" href="#note_3068"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3068</span></span></a> The bricks of a Mithraeum at Carnuntum
bear the stamp of the 15th Legion, and the inscriptions
contain several dedications by soldiers of the two corps.<a id="noteref_3069" name="noteref_3069" href="#note_3069"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3069</span></span></a> The

had fought under Corbulo against the Parthians, and had
borne a part in suppressing the Jewish revolt of 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> We
may be sure that the gaps in its ranks were filled by eastern
recruits.<a id="noteref_3070" name="noteref_3070" href="#note_3070"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3070</span></span></a> The soldiers of other corps, such as the Legions

and took part in the erection of buildings and in monumental
offerings.<a id="noteref_3071" name="noteref_3071" href="#note_3071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3071</span></span></a> It was probably through officers, transferred from
the Danube, that the worship was introduced into the camp of
Lambaesis in Numidia. There is a tablet of the third century to
Mithra in that camp, dedicated by a prefect of the 3rd Legion,
who was born at Carnuntum.<a id="noteref_3072" name="noteref_3072" href="#note_3072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3072</span></span></a> In Noricum and Rhaetia, the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page596">[pg 596]</span><a name="Pg596" id="Pg596" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Pannonia. But a corner of the former province was once
guarded by a corps from Commagene, which has left traces of
its presence in the name of a town on the Danube and in
some monuments to Mithra.<a id="noteref_3073" name="noteref_3073" href="#note_3073"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3073</span></span></a> In Rhaetia his remains are

and the region of the Upper Rhine, we find ourselves in a
district once more teeming with relics of Mithra. Not only has
this region given to the light the largest number of his chapels,<a id="noteref_3075" name="noteref_3075" href="#note_3075"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3075</span></span></a>
but the bas-reliefs found in their ruins surpass all others in
their dimensions and the completeness of their symbolism.
The tauroctonus group of Osterburken is regarded as the
masterpiece of Mithraist art in its complex variety and the
vivid and masterly skill of the execution.<a id="noteref_3076" name="noteref_3076" href="#note_3076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3076</span></span></a> Many of the
German inscriptions to Mithra are offered by simple citizens.
But, from the number dedicated by soldiers also, Cumont may
be right in tracing the diffusion of the worship once more to
military zeal. It is true, the legions quartered in Germany
did not contain any considerable number of recruits from the
East. But they were in constant communication with the
camps upon the Danube, where oriental influences were strong.
It is significant that the earliest inscription to Mithra yet
found in Germany, of the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 148, is that of a centurion
of the 8th Legion, which was quartered in Moesia from
47 till 69, and which during that time had frequent communications
with the East. The legion was in 70 removed
from Moesia to Upper Germany.<a id="noteref_3077" name="noteref_3077" href="#note_3077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3077</span></span></a> It is probable that, however
it was introduced, the worship of Mithra may have found its
way into the valley of the Neckar, and even to the Lower
Rhine, before the end of the first century. Coins of Trajan
have been found in the temple at Friedberg;<a id="noteref_3078" name="noteref_3078" href="#note_3078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3078</span></span></a> a series of coins

line of conquest may be followed to Boulogne, the station of
the British fleet. Thence the cult passed easily to London,
which, in the time of Tacitus, was a centre of great commercial

great camps of Caerleon, Chester and York. At all the guardposts
of the great rampart of Hadrian, there were chapels of
the eastern god, and the inscriptions show that the officers at
this remote outpost of the Empire maintained a warm devotion
to the religion of their native East.<a id="noteref_3081" name="noteref_3081" href="#note_3081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3081</span></span></a>

The regions of the western world on which Mithra, from

Western Gaul, Spain, and North Africa.<a id="noteref_3082" name="noteref_3082" href="#note_3082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3082</span></span></a> Syrian merchants,
slaves, or soldiers, had established the worship at Lyons, Arles,
and Narbonne. But Elusa is the only place in Aquitaine
where traces of it have been found. In Spain, the legionaries
carried it only to a few remote frontier posts in Asturia or
Gallicia.<a id="noteref_3083" name="noteref_3083" href="#note_3083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3083</span></span></a> The African garrisons, recruited largely from the
surrounding country, remained true to their native deities, and
the few inscriptions to Mithra at great military strongholds,
like Lambesi, are probably due to the devotion of some of the
higher officers, who had been transferred to these distant
quarters from Syria or the Danube.<a id="noteref_3084" name="noteref_3084" href="#note_3084"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3084</span></span></a>

If we try to explain the fascination of this religion of
central Asia for western minds, we must seek it partly in
its theological system, partly in its ritual and clerical organisation,
still more in its clear promise of a life beyond the grave.
In these characteristics, Mithraism differed profoundly from
Graeco-Roman paganism, and seemed, in the eyes of the
Christian apologists, to be a deceptive imitation of the rites
and doctrines of the Christian Church. Inspired with the
tendency or ambition to gather many races into its fold,
Mithraism was a compound of the influences of very different
ages, and offered many footholds for the faith or superstition
of the lands which it traversed in its march. It drew, from
points widely severed in time and place, doctrine or symbolism
or rite, from the ancient lands of the Aryan race, from the
mountain homes of the Persians, from Babylon and Phrygia
and Commagene, from the philosophy of Greece, and the
mythologies of all the peoples among whom it came. Yet it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page598">[pg 598]</span><a name="Pg598" id="Pg598" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>never to the end ceased to be a Persian cult. In the Divine
Comedy of Lucian, as it may be called, Mithra, even when he
is admitted to Olympus, cannot speak in Greek.<a id="noteref_3085" name="noteref_3085" href="#note_3085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3085</span></span></a> His name
is never disguised or translated. On many of his inscriptions
the names of the old Mazdean pantheon, such as Ahriman, the
power of evil, still figure.<a id="noteref_3086" name="noteref_3086" href="#note_3086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3086</span></span></a> The mystic beasts which are always
present in the sacred scene of the tauroctonus, the lion, the

Persian theology.<a id="noteref_3087" name="noteref_3087" href="#note_3087"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3087</span></span></a> The cave, which was the immemorial

back to Zoroastrian symbolism.<a id="noteref_3088" name="noteref_3088" href="#note_3088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3088</span></span></a> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">petra genetrix</span></span>, which

The young god, emerging from the spires of rock, round which
a serpent coils itself, is the first radiance of the upspringing

to conceive how these frigid astronomical fancies should form
a part in a religious system which undoubtedly from the
beginning had a profound moral effect on its adherents. Yet
it is well to remember that there was a time when the mystery
of the stellar spaces, and the grandeur and beneficence of the
sun, were the most awful and impressive things in human
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page599">[pg 599]</span><a name="Pg599" id="Pg599" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>experience. The cold scrutiny of the telescope has long since
robbed the heavenly orbs of their mystic power over human
destiny. Yet even now, a man who has not been imbued
with the influence of modern science, may, on some calm,
starlit summer night, travel back in imagination to the dreams
of the early star-gazers on the Ganges or the Euphrates, and
fancy that, in the far solitary splendour and ordered movement
of those eternal fires, which shine so serene and pitiless on this
small point in the universe, there may be forces to guide or
signs to predict the course of mortal destiny. Nor was it an
altogether unworthy dream, which floated before the minds
of so many generations, that in those liquid depths of space,
where, in the infinite distance, the radiance of widely-severed
constellations blends into a luminous haze, might be the eternal
abode of spirits who, after their sojourn in the flesh, have
purged themselves of earthly taint.<a id="noteref_3094" name="noteref_3094" href="#note_3094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3094</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relative influence of Babylon and ancient Iran in
moulding the theology of Mithraism, has long been a subject
of controversy. The opposing schools, represented by Lajard
and Windischmann,<a id="noteref_3095" name="noteref_3095" href="#note_3095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3095</span></span></a> have been discredited or reconciled by
saner methods of criticism, and wider archaeological knowledge.
It is now seen that while Babylonia has left a deep impress
on the creed of Mithra, yet the original Aryan or Persian
elements still maintained their ascendency. Mithra, in his long
journey, came under many influences; and he absorbed many
alien ideas from the cults and art of the many lands through
which he travelled. His tolerance, indeed, was one great
secret of his power. But, while he absorbed, he assimilated
and transmuted. He remained the god of Persia, while he
gathered into his creed mystic elements that might appease the
spiritual cravings of the western world.<a id="noteref_3096" name="noteref_3096" href="#note_3096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3096</span></span></a> His system came to
represent the best theological expression of the long movement
of pagan mysticism, which, beginning with the mythic names
of Orpheus and Pythagoras, organised in the classic mysteries,
elevated and glorified by the genius of Plato, ended, if it has
ended, in the Neo-Platonic movement which offered a last
resistance to the Christian church. The central ideas of that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page600">[pg 600]</span><a name="Pg600" id="Pg600" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>theory of life and death were presented to the neophyte in the
mysteries of Mithra, and one of the last expounders of the
Platonic creed, in the reign of Theodosius, had probably
been initiated in one of the last chapels of the worship.<a id="noteref_3097" name="noteref_3097" href="#note_3097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3097</span></span></a> In
that vision of human destiny, of the descent and ascent
of the human soul, the old Orphic doctrine is united with the
star-lore of the Euphrates. Travelling towards its future
prison-house in the flesh, the spirit which leaves the presence
of Ormuzd descends by the gate of Cancer, through the
spheres of the seven planets, and in each acquires a new
faculty appropriate to its earthly state. The Mithraist
discipline and sacraments prepare it for the ascent after death.
When the soul at last leaves its mortal prison, it has to submit
to a great judgment in the presence of Mithra, and if it pass
the ordeal, it may then return through the seven spheres, at
each stage divesting itself of those passions or earthly powers,
which it had taken on for a time in its downward journey.<a id="noteref_3098" name="noteref_3098" href="#note_3098"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3098</span></span></a>
Finally, through the remote gate of Capricorn, its sublimated
essence will pass back again to ecstatic union with the
Supreme. It is thus that the East and West, Orphic mysteries
and Chaldaean astrology, combined to satisfy the craving for a
moral faith and the vision of another world.

The religion of Mithra probably achieved its highest
victory through an ethical theology, typified and made
concrete to the average worshipper by an elaborate symbolism
in rite and sculptured scene. But it had also a cosmic
theology. Mithra, in virtue of his moral power, became in
the end the central figure. But in nearly all his chapels can
be discovered a divine hierarchy, in which, for ages, he did
not hold the foremost rank. The highest place is given to
Infinite Time, without sex or passions, or properly without
even a name, although in order to bring him within the
vulgar ken, he may be called Cronus or Saturn and imaged in
stone as a lion, wrapped in the coils of a snake.<a id="noteref_3099" name="noteref_3099" href="#note_3099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3099</span></span></a> He is the
author of life and death; he carries the keys of heaven, and
in his limitless sway, he is identified with the unbending
power of Fate. Like other cosmic systems of the East
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page601">[pg 601]</span><a name="Pg601" id="Pg601" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Mazdean explained the universe by a succession of
emanations from the Infinite First Cause.<a id="noteref_3100" name="noteref_3100" href="#note_3100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3100</span></span></a> From his own
essence, Cronus engendered Earth and Heaven, whom mythologers
may call Jupiter and Juno, and they in turn give
life to Ocean. Jupiter, as in classical mythology, succeeded
to the power of Cronus, and gave to the world the Olympian
deities, along with Fortune, Themis, and the Fates. In the
hemisphere of gloom and evil, another order was engendered
by Infinite Time, which is represented by Ahriman, or, in the
fancy of more western lands, by Pluto and Hecate. The evil
spirits, who are their progeny, like the Titans of Greek legend,
have tried to storm Olympus, and been hurled back to the
under world.<a id="noteref_3101" name="noteref_3101" href="#note_3101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3101</span></span></a> There they still retain their power to plague and
corrupt the race of men; but, by means of incantation, and
sacrifice, their malice may be turned aside. In this daemonology
Mithraism joined hands with the new Platonism, of which
Plutarch, as we have seen, was one of the earliest apostles, and
the affinity between them continued to the last age of paganism.<a id="noteref_3102" name="noteref_3102" href="#note_3102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3102</span></span></a>
But it was in its divinisation of the elemental powers and
heavenly bodies that this religion probably obtained its most
powerful hold on an age profoundly fatalist and superstitious.
The strife of the four elements figures under animal symbolism
on innumerable sculptures of the chapels of Mithra, around
the image of the bull-slaying God.<a id="noteref_3103" name="noteref_3103" href="#note_3103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3103</span></span></a> The divine fire which

Phosphorus, as a naked boy, bearing a torch in each hand.
On the opposite side, Selene, crowned with the crescent and
erect in her car, is urging her team of oxen downwards towards
the gloom. On another piece, also found in the heart of
Germany, there is an impressive scene, in which Mithra and
the Sun, arrayed in eastern costume, stand side by side over a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page602">[pg 602]</span><a name="Pg602" id="Pg602" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>huge slaughtered bull. The sun god is handing to Mithra a

The most popular, and the least wholesome, element, which
Mithraism borrowed from Babylon, was the belief in planetary
influence. The seven planets became the arbiters of human
destiny, and their number acquired a hieratic significance.<a id="noteref_3107" name="noteref_3107" href="#note_3107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3107</span></span></a>
The days of the week and the seven principal metals were
consecrated to them. The various grades of initiation into the
mysteries of Mithra found a correspondence in the intervals of
the seven spheres.<a id="noteref_3108" name="noteref_3108" href="#note_3108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3108</span></span></a> The soul, in descending to its earthly
tenement for a season, passes through their successive realms,
and assumes appropriate faculties in each, just as, on its
release and ascension, it divests itself of them, one by one,
as it returns to the region of ethereal purity. But the
astral doctrine, introduced into the system of Iran from
Chaldaea, was a dangerous addition to the creed. It was
a fatal heritage from ages of benumbing superstition, and,
while it gave an immense impetus to the progress of the solar
cult, it counterbalanced, and, to some extent, neutralised its
more spiritual and salutary doctrines.<a id="noteref_3109" name="noteref_3109" href="#note_3109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3109</span></span></a> A co-ordinate evil
power, side by side with the beneficent Creator and Preserver,
and his revealer and mediator, a host of daemons, tempting to
sin, as well as visiting men with calamity, an iron Fate at the
centre of the Universe, whose inevitable decrees are at once
indicated and executed by the position and motions of the
planets—all this gloomy doctrine lay like a nightmare on the
human mind for many ages, and gave birth to all sorts of evil
arts to discover or avert or direct the pitiless forces which
controlled the fate of man. This is the dark side of Mithra
worship, and, in this evil tradition from Babylon, which
partially overlaid the purer creed of Persia, we may find some
explanation of the strange blending of dark superstition with
moral earnestness which characterised the reaction of Julian,
the votary of the Sun, and the patron of Maximus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, although the deification of the great elemental powers
and the mingled charm and terror of astrology gave the
religion of Mithra a powerful hold on the West, there were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page603">[pg 603]</span><a name="Pg603" id="Pg603" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>other and nobler elements in his system which cannot escape
the candid enquirer. The old unmoral, external paganism no
longer satisfied the spiritual wants of all men in the second
century. It is true the day will probably never come when
the religion of many will not begin and end in solemn, stately
rite, consecrated to the imagination by ancient use, and
captivating the sense by scrupulously ordered ceremonial.
The ritualist and the puritan conception of worship will
probably always exist side by side, for they represent two
opposite conceptions of religion which can never entirely blend.
And certainly in the days of M. Aurelius the placid satisfaction
in a sumptuous sacrifice, at which every word of the ancient
litany was rendered to the letter, was still profoundly felt by
many, even by the philosophic emperor himself. But there
were other ideas in the air. Men heard from wandering
preachers that God required other offerings than the <span class="tei tei-q">“blood of
bulls and the ashes of a heifer,”</span> that the true worship was in
the sacrifice of a purified spirit.<a id="noteref_3110" name="noteref_3110" href="#note_3110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3110</span></span></a> Platonist and Pythagorean,
even when they might reverently handle the ancient symbolism
of ritual, were teaching that communion with the Infinite
Father was only possible to a soul emancipated from the
tyranny of sense. Moreover, as we have seen, the new
Platonism was striving to create some mediatorial power between
the world of sense and the Infinite Spirit, transcending all old
materialistic fancies of the Divine.<a id="noteref_3111" name="noteref_3111" href="#note_3111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3111</span></span></a> This Platonic daemonology,
indeed, from the Christian point of view, was a very crude and
imperfect attempt to bridge the gulf. And it had the graver
fault that it was really a revival of the old mythology. Yet
it was also an attempted reformation. It was an effort to
introduce a moral influence into paganism. It was an effort
to substitute for physical and naturalistic conceptions a moral
theory of the government of the world. That was surely an
immense advance in religious history, and foreshadowed the
great revolution which was to launch the western world on a
new spiritual career. The hosts of sister spirits, whom
Maximus of Tyre imagines as surrounding and sustaining the
life of men, involved in the darkness and sorrow of time, are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page604">[pg 604]</span><a name="Pg604" id="Pg604" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a conception strange to the old paganism. And the need of
mediatorial sympathy, of a sympathetic link, however slight,
with the dim, awful Power, ever receding into more remote and
mysterious distances, was also connected with the need of some
assurance, or fainter hope, of a life beyond the tomb. To that
hope the old classical paganism afforded only slight and
shadowy nutriment. Yet, from hundreds of sepulchral inscriptions
the yearning, often darkened by a doubt, appeals
with pathetic force. Apart, in fact, from the crowd of mere
antiquarian formalists and lovers of spectacle, there were, we
believe, a great mass who longed for some channel through
which they might have the faintest touch of sympathy with
the Infinite Spirit; for some promise, however veiled in
enigmatic symbolism, that this poor, puzzling, ineffectual life
should not close impotently at death.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all the Mazdean pantheon, it has been remarked, Mithra
was the only divine figure that profoundly affected the religious
imagination of Europe. Who can dare at this distance to
pierce the mystery? But we may conjecture that the ascendency
is partly due to his place as mediator in the Persian
hierarchy, partly to the legends, emblazoned on so many slabs,
of his miraculous and Herculean triumphs; but still more to
the moral and sacramental support, and the sure hope of
immortal life which he offered to his faithful worshippers.
Mithra came as a deliverer from powers of evil and as a
mediator between man and the remote Ormuzd. He bears
the latter office in a double sense. In the cosmic system, as
lord of light, he is also lord of the space between the heavenly
ether and the mists of earth. As a solar deity, he is the
central point among the planetary orbs.<a id="noteref_3112" name="noteref_3112" href="#note_3112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3112</span></span></a> In the ubiquitous
group of the slaughtered bull, Mithra stands between the two
Dadophori, Cautes and Cautopates, who form with him a sort
of Trinity, and are said to be incarnations of him.<a id="noteref_3113" name="noteref_3113" href="#note_3113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3113</span></span></a> One of these
figures in Mithraic sculpture always bears a torch erect, the
other a torch turned downwards to the earth. They may have
a double significance. They may figure the ascending light of
dawn, and the last radiance of day as it sinks below the horizon.
They may be taken to image the growth of solar strength to
its midsummer triumphs, and its slow decline towards fading
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page605">[pg 605]</span><a name="Pg605" id="Pg605" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>autumn and the cold of winter. Or again, they may shadow
forth the wider and more momentous processes of universal
death and resurgent life. But Mithra also became a mediator
in the moral sense, standing between Ormuzd and Ahriman,
the powers of good and evil, as Plutarch conceives him.<a id="noteref_3114" name="noteref_3114" href="#note_3114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3114</span></span></a> He
is the ever victorious champion, who defies and overthrows the
malignant demons that beset the life of man; who, above all,
gives the victory over the last foe of humanity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The legend of Mithra in hymn or litany is almost entirely
lost. But antiquarian ingenuity and cultivated sympathy have
plausibly recovered some of its meanings from the many
sculptural remains of his chapels. On the great monuments
of Virunum, Mauls, Neuenheim, and Osterburken, can be
seen the successive scenes of the hero’s career. They begin
with his miraculous birth from the <span class="tei tei-q">“mother rock,”</span> which was
familiar to Justin Martyr, S. Jerome, and many of the Fathers.<a id="noteref_3115" name="noteref_3115" href="#note_3115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3115</span></span></a>
The dedications <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">petrae genetrici</span></span> abound along the Danube, and
the sacred stone was an object of adoration in many chapels.<a id="noteref_3116" name="noteref_3116" href="#note_3116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3116</span></span></a>
A youthful form, his head crowned with a Phrygian cap, a
dagger in one hand, and a torch in the other, is pictured
emerging from an opening rock, around which sometimes a
serpent is coiled. Shepherds from the neighbouring mountain
gaze in wonder at the divine birth, and presently come nearer
to adore the youthful hero, and offer him the firstlings of their
flocks and fields.<a id="noteref_3117" name="noteref_3117" href="#note_3117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3117</span></span></a> And again, a naked boy is seen screening
himself from the violence of the wind in the shelter of a fig
tree; he eats of its fruit and makes himself a garment from
the leaves.<a id="noteref_3118" name="noteref_3118" href="#note_3118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3118</span></span></a> In another scene, the sacred figure appears in full
eastern costume, armed with a bow from which he launches
an arrow against a rock rising in front of him.<a id="noteref_3119" name="noteref_3119" href="#note_3119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3119</span></span></a> From the
spot where the arrow strikes the stone, a fountain gushes forth,
and the water is eagerly caught in his upturned palms by a
form kneeling below. Then follow the famous scenes of the
chase and slaughter of the mystic bull. At first the beast is seen
borne in a skiff over an expanse of waters. Soon afterwards
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page606">[pg 606]</span><a name="Pg606" id="Pg606" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he is grazing quietly in a meadow, when Mithra comes upon
the scene. In one monument the hero is carrying the bull
upon his shoulders; in others he is borne upon the animal’s
back, grasping it by the horns. Or again, the bull is seen in full
career with the hero’s arms thrown around his neck. At last
the bull succumbs to his rider’s courage, and is dragged by
the hind-legs, which are drawn over his captor’s shoulders, into
a cavern where the famous slaughter was enacted.<a id="noteref_3120" name="noteref_3120" href="#note_3120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3120</span></span></a> The
young god, his mantle floating on the wind, kneels on the
shoulder of the fallen beast, draws back its head with his left
hand, while with the other he buries his dagger in its neck.<a id="noteref_3121" name="noteref_3121" href="#note_3121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3121</span></span></a>
Below this scene are invariably sculptured the scorpion, the
faithful dog, and the serpent lapping the flowing blood.
The two Dadophori, silent representatives of the worlds of light
and gloom, one on each side, are always calm watchers of the
mystic scene. But the destruction of the bull was not a mere
spectacle of death. It was followed by a miracle of fresh
springing life and fertility, and, here and there, on the slabs
are seen ears of corn shooting from the tail of the dying
beast, or young plants and flowers springing up around.<a id="noteref_3122" name="noteref_3122" href="#note_3122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3122</span></span></a> His
blood gives birth to the vine which yields the sacred juice
consecrated in the mysteries. Thus, in spite of the scorpion
and the serpent, symbols of the evil powers, who seek to
wither and sterilise the sources of vitality, life is ever rising
again from the body of death.<a id="noteref_3123" name="noteref_3123" href="#note_3123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3123</span></span></a>

Mithra’s mysterious reconciliation with the Sun is figured
in other groups.<a id="noteref_3124" name="noteref_3124" href="#note_3124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3124</span></span></a> Mithra, as usual, in eastern costume, has,
kneeling before him, a youthful figure either naked or lightly
clad. The god touches the head of the suppliant with some
mysterious symbol, and the subject of the rite raises his hands
in prayer. The mystic symbol is removed, and Mithra sets a
radiant crown on the suppliant’s head. This reconciliation of
the two deities is a favourite subject. In the sculpture of
Osterburken, they ratify their pact with solemn gestures before
an altar. Their restored harmony is commemorated in even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page607">[pg 607]</span><a name="Pg607" id="Pg607" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more solemn fashion. In one monument the two are reclining
on a couch at a solemn agape, with a table before them bearing
the sacred bread, which is marked with the cross, and both are
in the act of raising the cup in their right hands.<a id="noteref_3125" name="noteref_3125" href="#note_3125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3125</span></span></a>

The legend of Mithra, thus faintly and doubtfully reconstructed
from the sacred sculptures, in the absence of express
tradition, must probably for ever remain somewhat of an
enigma. It has been, since the third century, the battle-ground
of ingenious interpreters. To enumerate and discuss
these theories, many of them now discredited by archaeological
research, is far beyond the scope of this work. It is
clear that from the early Chaldaean magi, who, to some
extent, imposed their system on Iranian legend, down to the
Neo-Platonists, the god and his attendants were treated as
the symbols of cosmic theory. The birth from the rock
was the light of dawn breaking over serrated crests of
eastern hills.<a id="noteref_3126" name="noteref_3126" href="#note_3126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3126</span></span></a> The cave, which was always piously perpetuated
in the latest Mithraist architecture, was the solid
vault of heaven, and the openings pierced in its roof were
the stars shining through the celestial dome.<a id="noteref_3127" name="noteref_3127" href="#note_3127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3127</span></span></a> The fountain
which rose in every chapel, the fire on the altar, the animals
surrounding the bull, represent the powers of nature in their
changes and conflict. The young archer, causing water to
spring from the rock by a shot from his bow, marks the
miraculous cessation of prehistoric dearth, as the bull leaping
from a skiff perhaps commemorates a primaeval deluge. The
slaying of the bull, the central scene of all, may go back to
the exploits of the heroic pioneers of settled life, a Hercules
or a Theseus, who tamed the savage wilderness to the uses
of man. It had many meanings to different ages. To one
occupied with the processes of nature, it may have symbolised
the withering of the vegetative freshness of the world in midsummer
heats, yet with a promise of a coming spring. To
another it may have meant a victory over evil spirits and
powers of darkness.<a id="noteref_3128" name="noteref_3128" href="#note_3128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3128</span></span></a> Or it may, in the last days, have been
the prototype of that sacramental cleansing which gave assurance
of immortal life, and which seemed to the Fathers the
mockery of a Diviner Sacrifice.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There can be no doubt that Mithra and his exploits, in
response to a great need, came to have a moral and spiritual
meaning. From the earliest times, he is the mediator between
good and evil powers; ever young, vigorous, and victorious in
his struggles, the champion of truth and purity, the protector
of the weak, the ever vigilant foe of the hosts of daemons
who swarm round the life of man, the conqueror of death.
His religion, in spite of its astrology, was not one of fatalist
reverie; it was a religion of struggle and combat. In this
aspect it was congenial to the virile Roman temperament,
and, above all, to the temperament of the Roman soldier,
at once the most superstitious and the most strenuous of
men.<a id="noteref_3129" name="noteref_3129" href="#note_3129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3129</span></span></a> Who can tell what inspiration the young heroic
figure, wearing an air of triumphant vigour even on the rudest
slabs,<a id="noteref_3130" name="noteref_3130" href="#note_3130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3130</span></span></a> may have breathed into a worn old veteran, who kept
ceaseless watch against the Germans in some lonely post on
the Danube, when he spent a brief hour in the splendour of
the brilliantly lighted crypt, and joined in the old Mazdean
litany? Before him was the sacred group of the Tauroctonus,
full of so many meanings to many lands and ages, but which,
to his eyes, probably shed the light of victory over the perilous
combats of time, and gave assurance of a larger hope.
Suddenly, by the touch of an unseen hand, the plaque revolved,<a id="noteref_3131" name="noteref_3131" href="#note_3131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3131</span></span></a>
and he had before him the solemn agape of the two
deities in which they celebrated the peaceful close of their
mystic conflict. And he went away, assured that his hero
god was now enthroned on high, and watching over his faithful
soldiers upon earth.<a id="noteref_3132" name="noteref_3132" href="#note_3132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3132</span></span></a> At the same time, he had seen around
him the sacred symbols or images of all the great forces of
nature, and of the fires of heaven which, in their motions
and their effluences, could bring bane or happiness to men
below. In the chapels of Mithra, all nature became divine
and sacred, the bubbling spring, the fire on the cottage hearth,
the wind that levelled the pine tree or bore the sailor on his
voyage, the great eternal lights that brought seed-time and
harvest and parted day from night, the ever-welling vital
force in opening leaf and springing corn-ear, and birth of
young creatures, triumphing in regular round over the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page609">[pg 609]</span><a name="Pg609" id="Pg609" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>malignant forces which seem for a time to threaten decay

of light and hope in this world and the next.<a id="noteref_3133" name="noteref_3133" href="#note_3133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3133</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ancient world was craving for a promise of immortality.
Mithraism strove to nurse the hope, but, like the contemporaneous
Platonism and the more ancient Orphic lore, it
linked it with moral responsibility and grave consequences.
Votaries were taught that the soul descended by graduated fall
from the Most High to dwell for a season in the prison of the
flesh.<a id="noteref_3134" name="noteref_3134" href="#note_3134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3134</span></span></a> After death there is a great judgment, to decide the

during life are dragged down by Ahriman and his evil angels,
and may be consigned to torture, or may sink into endless
debasement. The pure, who have been fortified by the holy
mysteries, will mount upwards through the seven spheres, at
each stage parting with some of their lower elements, till, at
last, the subtilised essential spirit reaches the empyrean, and is
received by Mithra into the eternal light.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the conflict between good and evil, even on this earth,
will not last for ever. There will be a second coming of Mithra,
which is to be presaged by great plagues. The dead will
arise from their tombs to meet him. The mystic bull will
again be slain, and his blood, mingled with the juice of the
sacred Haoma, will be drunk by the just, and impart to them
the gift of eternal life.<a id="noteref_3136" name="noteref_3136" href="#note_3136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3136</span></span></a> Fire from heaven will finally devour
all that is evil. Thus the slaughter of the bull, which is the
image of the succession of decay and fructifying power in
physical nature, is also the symbol and guarantee of a final
victory over evil and death. And, typifying such lofty and
consolatory truths, it naturally met the eye of the worshipper
in every chapel. It was also natural that the taurobolium,
which was originally a rite of the Great Mother, should be
absorbed, like so many alien rites and ideas, by the religion
which was the great triumph of syncretism. The baptism of
blood was, indeed, a formal cleansing from impurity of the
flesh; but it was also cleansing in a higher sense. The
inscrip<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page610">[pg 610]</span><a name="Pg610" id="Pg610" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tions of the fourth century, which commemorate the blessing
of the holy rite, often close with the words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in aeternum
renatus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_3137" name="noteref_3137" href="#note_3137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3137</span></span></a> How far the phrase expressed a moral resurrection,
how far it records the sure hope of another life, we cannot
presume to say. Whether borrowed from Christian sources
or not, it breathes an aspiration strangely different from the
tone of old Roman religion, even at its best. There may have
been a good deal of ritualism in the cleansing of Mithra.
Yet Mithra was, from the beginning, a distinctly moral power,
and his worship was apparently untainted by the licence which
made other heathen worships schools of cruelty and lust. His
connection, indeed, with some of them, must at times have led
his votaries into more than doubtful company; Sabazius and
Magna Mater were dangerous allies.<a id="noteref_3138" name="noteref_3138" href="#note_3138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3138</span></span></a> Yet, on the whole, it
has been concluded that Mithraism was a gospel of truth and
purity, although the purity was often a matter of merely ceremonial
purification and abstinence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The day is far distant when the mass of men will be
capable of the austere mystic vision, which relies little on
external ceremonies of worship. Certainly the last ages of
paganism in the West were not ripe for any such reserved
spirituality. And the religions which captivated the ages
that preceded the triumph of the Catholic Church, while they
strove to satisfy the deeper needs of the spirit, were more
intensely sacerdotal, and more highly organised than the old
religions of Greece and Rome. Probably no small part of
their strength lay in sacramental mystery, and an occult
sacred lore which was the monopoly of a class set apart
from the world.<a id="noteref_3139" name="noteref_3139" href="#note_3139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3139</span></span></a> Our knowledge of the Mithraic priesthood

sounding of a bell.<a id="noteref_3143" name="noteref_3143" href="#note_3143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3143</span></span></a> And turning on a pivot, the sacred slab
in the apse displayed, for the adoration of the faithful, the
scene of the holy feast of Mithra and the Sun after their
reconciliation. The seventh day of the week was sacred to
the Sun, the sixteenth of each month to Mithra, and the 25th
of December, as marking the sun’s entrance on a new course
of triumph, was the great festival of Mithra’s sacred year.<a id="noteref_3144" name="noteref_3144" href="#note_3144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3144</span></span></a>

Initiation in the mysteries, after many rites of cleansing
and trial, was the crowning privilege of the Mithraist believer.
The gradation of spiritual rank, and the secrecy which bound
the votaries to one another in a sacred freemasonry, were a
certain source of power. S. Jerome alone has preserved for
us the seven grades through which the neophyte rose to full
communion. They were Corax, Cryphius, Miles, Leo, Perses,
Heliodromus, and Pater.<a id="noteref_3145" name="noteref_3145" href="#note_3145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3145</span></span></a> What their origin was who shall
say? They may correspond to the seven planets, and mark
the various stages of the descent of the soul into flesh, and
its rise again to the presence of God. According to Porphyry,
the first three stages were merely preliminary to complete
initiation. Only the Lions were full and real communicants,<a id="noteref_3146" name="noteref_3146" href="#note_3146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3146</span></span></a>
and the title Leo certainly appears oftenest on inscriptions.
The dignity Pater Patrum, or Pater Patratus, was much coveted,
and conferred a real authority over the brethren, with an
official title to their reverence.<a id="noteref_3147" name="noteref_3147" href="#note_3147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3147</span></span></a> The admission to each successive
grade was accompanied by symbolic ceremonies, as
when the Miles put aside the crown twice tendered to him,
saying that Mithra was his only crown.<a id="noteref_3148" name="noteref_3148" href="#note_3148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3148</span></span></a> The veil of
the Cryphius, and the Phrygian bonnet of the Perses, have a

which were made the subject of exaggeration and slander.
The neophyte, blindfold and bound, was obliged to pass
through flame. It was said that he had to take part in a
simulated murder with a blood-dripping sword. On the
sculpture of Heddernheim a figure is seen standing deep in
snow. These ceremonies probably went back to the scenes
and ages in which mutilations in honour of Bellona and Magna
Mater took their rise. They may also have been a lesson, or a
test of apathy and moral courage.<a id="noteref_3149" name="noteref_3149" href="#note_3149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3149</span></span></a> But the tales of murder

The votaries of Mithra, like those of Isis and other eastern
deities, formed themselves into guilds which were organised on
the model of ordinary sodalities and colleges. As funerary
societies, or under the shelter of Magna Mater, they escaped
persecution. They had their roll of members, their council of
decurions, their masters and curators.<a id="noteref_3151" name="noteref_3151" href="#note_3151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3151</span></span></a> And, like the secular

of their wealthier members and patrons.<a id="noteref_3152" name="noteref_3152" href="#note_3152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3152</span></span></a> One man might give

One undoubted cause of the success of Mithra in the West
was the spirit of fraternity and charity which was fostered
in his guilds. The hopeless obscurity and depression of the
plebeian and servile classes had some alleviation in companies
where, for the moment, the poor and lowly-born found himself
on an equality with his social superiors. Plebeians and the
slaves had a great part in the propagation of the eastern
worships, and especially that of the God of Light.<a id="noteref_3154" name="noteref_3154" href="#note_3154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3154</span></span></a> In his

Moreover, from the size of the chapels it is clear that the
congregations were generally small, so that the members of
lower social importance were not lost in a crowd.<a id="noteref_3156" name="noteref_3156" href="#note_3156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3156</span></span></a> Growing

they were pledged to secrecy and holy service, the sign or
brand made on the brow of the Miles, the ablutions or

and wine, which were only offered to the higher grades, may
well have seemed the last and worst profanation of the most
solemn Christian rite. The draught from the mystic cup,
originally the juice of Haoma, was supposed to have supernatural
effects. It imparted not only health and prosperity
and wisdom, but also the power to conquer the spirits of evil
and darkness, and a secret virtue which might elude the grasp
of death.<a id="noteref_3159" name="noteref_3159" href="#note_3159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3159</span></span></a>

The temples in which these rites took place repeated for ages
the same original type. Mithra and his cave are inseparable

cave-like crypt, which was the true sanctuary. On each side
there ran a bench of stone, on which was ranged the company
of the initiated.<a id="noteref_3163" name="noteref_3163" href="#note_3163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3163</span></span></a> The central aisle led up to the apse, against

of Chaldaean star-lore, with altars in front.<a id="noteref_3164" name="noteref_3164" href="#note_3164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3164</span></span></a> This was the

a dazzling scene. On either side the congregation knelt in
prayer. Countless lamps shed their brilliant light on the
forms of ancient Hellenic gods, or on the images of the mighty
powers of earth or ether<a id="noteref_3166" name="noteref_3166" href="#note_3166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3166</span></span></a>—above all, on the sacred scene which
was the memorial of the might of the <span class="tei tei-q">“unconquered.”</span> The
ancient rhythmic litany was chanted to the sound of music;
the lights came and went in startling alternations of splendour
and gloom. The draught of the sacred cup seemed to ravish
the sense. And the votary, as in the Isiac vision in Apuleius,
for a moment seemed borne beyond the bounds of space and
time into mystic distances.<a id="noteref_3167" name="noteref_3167" href="#note_3167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3167</span></span></a>

The Persian cult owed much of its success to imperial and
aristocratic favour. The last pagan emperor of the West,
the last generation of the pagan aristocracy, were devotees of
the Sun-god. It is a curious thing that even under the early
Empire Mithraism seems never to have suffered from the
suspicion and persecution with which other alien worships had
to contend.<a id="noteref_3168" name="noteref_3168" href="#note_3168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3168</span></span></a> Its close league with the cult of the Great Mother,
which, since the second century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, had been an established
institution, may have saved Mithra from official mistrust. He
also emerged into prominence in the age in which imperial

The apotheosis of the emperors began even in the time

to the lord of the world than even the common people of Italy.
The superstitious masses and the soldiery, indeed, were equal to
any enthusiasm of flattery and superstition. But the cultivated
upper class, in spite of the effusive compliance of court

Many historic causes made their posthumous elevation to
divine rank seem not unnatural. The cult of the Manes,
or good spirits of departed friends and ancestors, prepared the
Roman mind to adore the memory of the father of the State.

Greek cities raised altars to Rome and to Roman generals who

The influence of Egypt and Persia lent its force to stimulate
native and original tendencies to king-worship, and to develop
the principate of Augustus into the theocratic despotism of
Aurelian and Diocletian. The eastern peoples were always
eager to lavish on the emperors the adoration which they had
been used to offer to their native princes. The ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page617">[pg 617]</span><a name="Pg617" id="Pg617" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Pharaohs had been revered as incarnations of the deity and

useful a superstition. These ideas spread into Italy with
the diffusion of the Isiac cult among the upper class, and
through the influence of travellers and envoys who kept up
a fruitful intercourse between Alexandria and Rome. But
Egypt went rather too far for the western mind in its apotheosis
of kings.<a id="noteref_3185" name="noteref_3185" href="#note_3185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3185</span></span></a> A more potent and congenial influence came from
the lands of the remoter East. The Persians prostrated themselves
before their monarchs, but they did not actually adore
them as gods. They reverenced the daemon, or, in Roman
phrase, the <span class="tei tei-q">“genius Caesaris,”</span> without worshipping the monarch
himself.<a id="noteref_3186" name="noteref_3186" href="#note_3186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3186</span></span></a> The king was supposed to be enlightened, inspired,
and guarded by a heavenly grace; his brow was crowned by a
divine aureole. Yet he was not the equal of God. But the
majesty and fortune of kings was something divine and supernatural;
they reigned by special grace and had a divine protection.
The dynasties who succeeded to the great heritage of
the East exploited these ideas to the full, and the most solemn
oath was by the Fortune of the King.<a id="noteref_3187" name="noteref_3187" href="#note_3187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3187</span></span></a> The superstition of
Chaldaea, which connected all human destiny with the orbs of
heaven, exercised a profound influence for many centuries both
in the East and West. And the Sun, the monarch of the
heavens, often identified with Mithra, was regarded as the
special patron of kings, enduing them with irresistible power,
and guarding their lofty destiny. These ideas spread easily
from Pontus and Commagene into the western world. In
eastern cities, Caligula and Nero had altars raised to them as
solar deities,<a id="noteref_3188" name="noteref_3188" href="#note_3188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3188</span></span></a> and Tiridates offered to Nero the adoration due

strength from the ideas of the divinised destiny of eastern
monarchs. According to Plutarch, Tyche left the regions of
Assyria and Persia to make her home on the Palatine.<a id="noteref_3191" name="noteref_3191" href="#note_3191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3191</span></span></a> The

into the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fortuna Augusti,”</span> which appears on the imperial
coins from the reign of Vespasian. In the age of the
Antonines, the image of the goddess in gold always stood in
the prince’s bed-chamber, and was transferred at the hour of
his death to his successor.<a id="noteref_3192" name="noteref_3192" href="#note_3192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3192</span></span></a> With the reign of Commodus, who
was himself initiated both in the Isiac and Mithraic mysteries,
begins the temporary triumph of the oriental cults, which was
to reach its height in the reign of Julian. The absence of full
materials for the history of the third century,<a id="noteref_3193" name="noteref_3193" href="#note_3193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3193</span></span></a> a century crowded
with great events, and pregnant with great spiritual movements,
should perhaps impose greater caution in tracing the development
of imperial power than some writers have always observed.
Yet there can be little doubt that the monarchy of the West
tended to become a theocratic despotism, and that Persian Sun-worship
had a large share in this development. There was
always a sober sense in the West which rebelled against
the oriental apotheosis of the prince.<a id="noteref_3194" name="noteref_3194" href="#note_3194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3194</span></span></a> Yet the iterated

there were many approaches to the divine claims of the
monarchs of the East. The title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">invictus</span></span>, sacred to Mithra
and the Sun, was assumed by Commodus, and borne by his
successors.<a id="noteref_3197" name="noteref_3197" href="#note_3197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3197</span></span></a> The still more imposing title of <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal,”</span> springing
from the same origin, came into vogue in the third century,
and appears in the edicts of the last shadowy emperors of the
fifth. From the reign of Nero, the imperial crown with
darting rays, symbolised the solar ancestry of the prince.
Gallienus used to go forth crowned in this manner, and with
gold dust in his hair, and raised a colossal statue of himself in
the garb of the Sun.<a id="noteref_3198" name="noteref_3198" href="#note_3198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3198</span></span></a> The coins of Aurelian, who built the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page619">[pg 619]</span><a name="Pg619" id="Pg619" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>these assumptions so literally as the East. But metaphor
and imagery tended to become a real faith. The centre of
the great religion which was to be the last stronghold of
paganism, was the prototype of the emperor in the starry
world, and his protector on earth. And the solar grace which
surrounded the prince found an easy explanation in the mystic
philosophy of the soul’s descent which had been absorbed by
Mithraism. In coming to earth from the empyrean, the
future lord of the world received a special gift of grace and
power from the great luminary which is the source of light
and life. The religion of the Sun thus tended to become a
great spiritual support of an absolutism which was more and
more modelling itself on the royalty of the East. The cult of
the Sun, which was established in such splendour in 273 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>
by Aurelian, must have had a great effect in preparing for
the oriental claims of monarchy from the reign of Diocletian.
Thirty years after the foundation of the stately shrine on
the Esquiline, and only twenty years before the conversion
of Constantine, all the princes of the imperial house, Jovii
Herculii, Augusti, Caesares, as an inscription tells, united to
restore a temple of Mithra at Carnuntum, his holy city on the
Danube.<a id="noteref_3200" name="noteref_3200" href="#note_3200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3200</span></span></a> But the days of Mithra as the god of kings were
numbered. After the establishment of the Christian Empire, he
had a brief illusory triumph in the reign of Julian, and again in
the short-lived effort of reaction led by Eugenius and Nicomachus
Flavianus, which had a tragic close in the battle on the Frigidus.
Yet his mystic theology was the theme of debate among Roman
nobles, trained in the philosophy of Alexandria, long after his
last chapels had been buried in ruins; and his worship lingered
in secluded valleys of the Alps or the Vosges into the fifth
century.<a id="noteref_3201" name="noteref_3201" href="#note_3201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3201</span></span></a> The theocratic claim of monarchy, to which Mithra
lent his support for so many generations, was destined, in its
symbols and phrases, to have a long reign.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
M. Renan has hazarded the opinion that, if the Christian
Church had been stricken with some mortal weakness, Mithraism
might have become the religion of the western world.
And, indeed, its marvellously rapid diffusion in Italy and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page620">[pg 620]</span><a name="Pg620" id="Pg620" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>provinces along the Danube and the Rhine, in the second and
third centuries, might well have inspired the hope of such a
splendid destiny. Although it was primarily a kingly and
military creed, it appealed in the end to all classes, by many
various attractions. Springing from remote regions of the East,
it seemed instinctively to seize the opportunity offered by a
marvellous political unity, along with anarchy in morals and
religion, to satisfy the imperious needs of a world eager for
spiritual light and hope, but distracted among the endless
claimants for its devotion. Philosophy had long tried and was
still trying to find a spiritual synthesis, and to draw from old
mythologies a support for life and conduct. Might not
religion succeed where philosophy had failed? Or rather,
might not religion gather up into itself the forces of philosophy,
and transmute and glorify them in a great concrete symbol?
Might not the claims of the past be harmonised with the higher
intuitions of a more instructed age, and the countless cults
embraced within the circuit of the Roman power be reconciled
with the supreme reverence for one central divine figure, as the
liberties of an Alpine canton, like those of a great city of Asia,
were sheltered under the unchallenged supremacy of Rome?
Mithra made the effort, and for the time he succeeded. In his
progress to what seemed an almost assured victory, he swept into
his orbit the Greek and Latin and Phrygian gods—nay, even the
gods of Celtic cantons.<a id="noteref_3202" name="noteref_3202" href="#note_3202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3202</span></span></a> They all found a place in his crypts,
beside his own sacred image and the Persian deities of his
original home. Their altars were ranged around his chapels, and
were duly visited by his priests. Yet, though the Persian deity
might seem very cosmopolitan and liberal in his indulgence to
parochial devotion, he never abated his own lofty claims, and
he never forgot his ancestry. While he might ally himself
with Magna Mater and Jupiter Dolichenus, he coldly repulsed
any association with Isis and Serapis, who were his rivals for
oecumenical sway. The old hostility between the worships of
Persia and Egypt was only softened in the internecine conflict
of both with a more powerful foe. It is only in the last stone
records that a votary of Mithra is found combining a devotion
to Isis.<a id="noteref_3203" name="noteref_3203" href="#note_3203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3203</span></span></a> The claims of the Sun-god to spiritual primacy are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page621">[pg 621]</span><a name="Pg621" id="Pg621" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>expounded in the orations of Julian and the dissertations of
Praetextatus in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturnalia</span></span> of Macrobius. Monotheism in
the pagan world was not, indeed, a new thing. It goes back
to the philosophers of Ionia and Elea, to Aeschylus and Plato.
Nor was syncretism unknown to earlier ages. The Greeks of
the days of Herodotus identified the gods of Egypt with their
own, as Julius Caesar and Tacitus identified Gallic and German
deities with those of the Roman pantheon.<a id="noteref_3204" name="noteref_3204" href="#note_3204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3204</span></span></a> But the monotheistic
syncretism of Mithra was a broader and more sweeping
movement. Local and national gods represented single
aspects of nature. Mithra was seated at the centre on which
all nature depends. If nature-worship was to justify itself in
the eyes of philosophic reason, men must rise to the adoration
of the Sun-king, the head of a great hierarchy of divine forces,
by means of which he acts and diffuses his inexhaustible energy
throughout the universe. And such is the claim made for him
by Praetextatus, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturnalia</span></span> of Macrobius, who was a
high adept in the mysteries of Mithra.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the world needed more than a great physical force to
assuage its cravings; it demanded a moral God, Who could raise
before the eyes of men a moral ideal, and support them in striving
to attain it; One Who could guide and comfort in the struggles
of life, and in the darkness of its close, Who could prepare the
trembling soul for the great ordeal, in which the deeds done in
the body are sifted on the verge of the eternal world. In fulfilling
his part, Mithra could rely on his own early character as a
god of truth and righteousness, a mediator between the powers
of good and evil: he had also the experience of the classic
mysteries, stretching back to the legendary Orpheus, which, in
whatever crude, shadowy symbolism, had taught for ten
centuries the doctrine of a moral sequence between this life
and the next. The descent of the soul into gross material
form, and its possible ascent again, if duly fortified, to ethereal
worlds, was common to Mithra and the Orphic and Pythagorean
systems. Such a system on one side sad and pessimist, on
another was full of the energy of hope. And Mithraism
combined the two. It was a religion of strenuous effort and
warfare, with the prospect of high rewards in some far-off
eternal life.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page622">[pg 622]</span><a name="Pg622" id="Pg622" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is little wonder that the Fathers, from the second century,
saw in Mithra the most formidable foe of Christ. Indeed, the
resemblances between the two religions, some of them superficial,
others of a deeper kind, were very striking. How far
some of these were due to a common stock of ideas in East and
West, how far they were the result of conscious borrowing
and mutual imitation, seems to be an insoluble problem. The
most learned student of the cult of Mithra is the most cautious
in his conclusions on the subject.<a id="noteref_3205" name="noteref_3205" href="#note_3205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3205</span></span></a> On the one hand, the
two religions, in outlying regions of the Empire, long followed
different lines of dispersion. Christianity from its origin in
the religion of Israel, spread at first among the cities on the
Mediterranean, chiefly where there were colonies of Jews.<a id="noteref_3206" name="noteref_3206" href="#note_3206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3206</span></span></a> On
the other hand, outside Italy, Mithraism, which was propagated
by soldiers and imperial officers, followed the line of the
camps and centres of commerce chiefly along the great rivers
of the northern frontier. Yet at Ostia and Rome and elsewhere,
the two eastern religions must have been early brought face
to face. In the syncretism of that age, the age of Gnosticism,
rites and doctrines passed easily from one system to another.
Mithra certainly absorbed much from kindred worships of
Asia Minor, from Hellenic mysteries, and from Alexandrian
philosophy. It is equally certain that the Church did not
disdain a policy of accommodation, along with the consecration
of altars of Christ in the old shrines of paganism. The cult
of local heroes was transferred to saints and martyrs. Converts
found it hard to part with consecrated phrases and forms of
devotion, and might address Jesus in epithets sacred to the
Sun. Some Christians in the fifth century still saluted the
rising sun with a prayer.<a id="noteref_3207" name="noteref_3207" href="#note_3207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3207</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Futile attempts have been made to find parallels to Biblical
narrative or symbolism in the faint and faded legend of Mithra
recovered from his monuments, the miraculous birth, the
sacred rock, the adoration of the shepherds, the grotto,—above
all, in the mystic sacrifice of the bull, which seemed to occupy
the same space in Mithraic devotion as the Sacrifice on
Calvary. But one great weakness of Mithraism lay precisely
here—that, in place of the narrative of a Divine life, instinct
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page623">[pg 623]</span><a name="Pg623" id="Pg623" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with human sympathy, it had only to offer the cold symbolism
of a cosmic legend. In their offices and sacramental system
the two religions had a more real affinity. Mithra had his
baptism and confirmation of new disciples, his ablutions, ascetic
preparation for the sacred mysteries, and holy feasts of the consecrated
bread and wine, where the mystic draught gave purity
and life to soul and body, and was the passport to a life in God.
The sacerdotal and liturgical character of his worship, with its
striking symbolism, using to the full the emotional effects of
lights and music and sacred pomp, offered to souls, who were
ripe for a diviner faith, some of that magical charm which was
to be exerted over so many ages by the Catholic Church. There
are, however, deeper and more fundamental resemblances between
the faiths of Mithra and of Christ, and it was to these that the
Persian cult owed its great superiority to classical mythology
and the official Roman paganism. It responded to a great
spiritual movement, of which it is one great object of this book
to show the sweep and direction. Formal devotion and ascetic
discipline were linked with lofty doctrines as to the origin of the
human spirit and an immortal destiny, depending on conduct,
as well as sacramental grace, through Mithra the mediator.
While the vulgar may have rested in the external charm and
power of the worship, there were others who drank in a more
spiritual creed expounded to us by one of the last Neo-Platonic
votaries of the Sun-God. It told of a fall of the soul into the
duress of the body, for a brief period of probation, of a
resurrection and great judgment, of a final ascent and beatitude
in the life in God, or of endless exile from His presence.<a id="noteref_3208" name="noteref_3208" href="#note_3208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3208</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet the two systems were separated by an impassable
gulf, and Mithra had associations which could not save him
from the fate of Jupiter and Demeter, of Hecate and Isis.
It is true that his fate was hastened by hostile forces and
causes external to religion. Many of his shrines in the
Danubian provinces, and along the upper Rhine, were desolated
and buried in ruins by the hordes of invaders in the third
century.<a id="noteref_3209" name="noteref_3209" href="#note_3209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3209</span></span></a> And in the fourth century, the fiercest assaults of
the Christian Empire were directed against the worship which
was thought to be the patron of magic arts, and a device
of the Evil One to travesty and defy the Religion of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page624">[pg 624]</span><a name="Pg624" id="Pg624" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Cross.<a id="noteref_3210" name="noteref_3210" href="#note_3210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3210</span></span></a> But material force, however fiercely and decisively
exerted, although it hastened the doom of the Persian god,
only anticipated an inevitable defeat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A certain severity in Mithraism, which marked it off honourably
from other worships of the East, also weakened it as a
popular and enduring force. The absence of the feminine
charm in its legend, while it saved it from the sensual taint
of other heathen systems, deprived it of a fascination for the
softer and more emotional side of human nature.<a id="noteref_3211" name="noteref_3211" href="#note_3211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3211</span></span></a> Although
women may, perhaps, have not been altogether excluded from
his mysteries,<a id="noteref_3212" name="noteref_3212" href="#note_3212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3212</span></span></a> still Mithra did not welcome them with the
warm sympathy which gave Demeter and Magna Mater and
Isis so firm a hold on the imagination of women for many
generations. The Mater Dolorosa has in all ages been an
enthralling power. The legend of the Tauroctonus was a
religion for strenuous men. And even its symbolism, with all
its strange spell, seems to lack depth and warmth for human
nature as a whole. It would indeed be rash to set limits to
the power of pious sentiment to transfigure and vivify the most
unspiritual materials. And the slaughtered bull in the apse
of every chapel of Mithra may have aroused in the end visions
and mystic emotion which had passed far beyond the sphere
of astral symbolism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet such spiritual interpretation of ancient myth is only
for the few, who find in a worship what they bring. For
the gross masses, the symbolism of natural processes, however
majestic, could never have won that marvellous power which
has made a single Divine, yet human, life the inexhaustible
source of spiritual strength for all the future. With all his
heroic effort to make himself a moral and spiritual force,
Mithra remained inextricably linked with the nature-worships
of the past. And, with such associations, even the God of
light could not be lord of the spiritual future of humanity.
Mithraism, with all its strange moral force, with all its charm of
antiquity and sacramental rite, with all its charity and tolerance,
had within it the germs of a sure mortality. In its tolerance lay
precisely its great weakness. The Christian Church might,
in S. Augustine’s phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">“spoil the Egyptians,”</span> it might borrow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page625">[pg 625]</span><a name="Pg625" id="Pg625" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and adapt rites and symbols from pagan temples, or ideas from
Greek philosophy.<a id="noteref_3213" name="noteref_3213" href="#note_3213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3213</span></span></a> But in borrowing, it transfigured them.
In all that was essential, the Church would hold no truce with
paganism. <span class="tei tei-q">“Break the idols and consecrate the temples”</span>
was the motto of the great Pontiff. But Mithra was ready to
shelter the idols under his purer faith. The images of Jupiter
and Venus, of Mars and Hecate, of the local deities of Dacia
and Upper Germany, find a place in his chapels beside the
antique symbols of the Persian faith.<a id="noteref_3214" name="noteref_3214" href="#note_3214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3214</span></span></a> And thus, in spite
of a lofty moral mysticism, Mithra was loaded with the
heritage of the heathen past. A man admitted to his highest
ministry might also worship at the old altars of Greece
and Rome. The last hierophant of Eleusis was a high-priest
of Mithra.<a id="noteref_3215" name="noteref_3215" href="#note_3215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3215</span></span></a> Human nature and religious sentiment are so
complex that men of the sincere monotheistic faith of
Symmachus, Praetextatus, and Macrobius, have left the almost
boastful record of an all-embracing laxity of tolerance on their
tombs.<a id="noteref_3216" name="noteref_3216" href="#note_3216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3216</span></span></a> On many of these slabs you may read that the man
who has been a <span class="tei tei-q">“father”</span> in the mysteries of Mithra, who has
been <span class="tei tei-q">“born again”</span> in the taurobolium, is also a priest of
Hecate, the goddess of dark arts and baleful spirits of the
night.<a id="noteref_3217" name="noteref_3217" href="#note_3217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3217</span></span></a> Through the astral fatalism of Babylon, Mithra was
inseparably connected with the darkest superstitions of East
or West,<a id="noteref_3218" name="noteref_3218" href="#note_3218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3218</span></span></a> which covered all sorts of secret crime and perfidy,
which lent themselves to seduction, conspiracy, and murder,
which involved the denial of a moral Providence of the world.
Many a pious devotee of Mithra and Hecate would have
recoiled, as much as we do, from the last results of his
superstition. Such people probably wished only to gain
another ally in facing the terrors of the unseen world. Yet
there can be little doubt that the majestic supremacy of
Mithra, through its old connection with Babylon, sheltered
some of the most degrading impostures of superstition.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So rooted is religious sentiment in reverence for the past,
for what our fathers have loved and venerated, that men will
long tolerate, or even wistfully cherish, sacred forms and ideas
which their moral sense has outgrown. Down to the last years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page626">[pg 626]</span><a name="Pg626" id="Pg626" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the fourth century, the Persian worship was defended with
defiant zeal by members of the proudest Roman houses. In
their philosophic gatherings in the reign of Honorius, they found
in Sun-worship the sum and climax of the pagan devotion of
the past.<a id="noteref_3219" name="noteref_3219" href="#note_3219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3219</span></span></a> Many a pious old priest of Mithra, in the reign of
Gratian, was probably filled with wonder and sorrow when he
saw a Gracchus and his retinue break into the sanctuary
and tear down the venerable symbols from the wall of the
apse.<a id="noteref_3220" name="noteref_3220" href="#note_3220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3220</span></span></a> He deemed himself the prophet of a pure immemorial
faith, as pure as that of Galilee. He was probably a man of
irreproachable morals, with even a certain ascetic sanctity,
unspotted by the world. He treasured the secret lore of the
mysterious East, which sped the departing soul with the last
comforting sacraments on its flight to ethereal worlds. But he
could not see, or he could not regret, that every day when he
said his liturgy, as he made the round of the altars, he was
lending the authority of a purer faith to other worships which
had affrighted or debauched and enervated the Roman world
for forty generations. He could not see that the attempt to wed
a high spiritual ideal with nature-worship was doomed to failure.
The masses around him remained in their grossness and darkness.
And on that very day, it may be, one of his aristocratic
disciples, high in the ranks of Mithra’s sacred guilds, was
attending a priestly college which was charged with the
guardianship of gross and savage rites running back to Evander,
or he was consulting a Jewish witch, or a Babylonian diviner,
on the meaning of some sinister omen, or he may have been
sending down into the arena, with cold proud satisfaction, a
band of gallant fighters from the Thames or the Danube, to
butcher one another for the pleasure of the rabble of Rome.
Mithra, the Unconquered, the god of many lands and dynasties
from the dawn of history, was a fascinating power. But, at his
best, he belonged to the order which was vanishing.

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
